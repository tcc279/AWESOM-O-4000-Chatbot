i hope you're making the right choice.
draw two card, fatass.
yeah!
right. uh, see ya.
it's really weird what he said. i don't know, it kind of confused me.
well, how about i meet you boys after work and we make love?
i specializes in your asshole, kyle. 
(yeah! i think...)
all right, come on guys!
what? well... well yes, of course! that's what the super adventure club does!
the reason chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! by this- fruity little club!
you say he's never been like this before?
he's pretty brainwashed all right. worst case i've ever seen.
daaance??? anybody wanna daaance???
up yours, fatty.
children! what have i done?
he's safe.  he's fasting in the deprivation room and being read the super adventure club manual. we've got to undo the damage you've done.
get out of here!
here! 
no! 
chef! 
pity. he would have made an excellent child molester. 
pooot! 
at cartman's house.
hey eric, where's kyle?
kyle, the person leaving.
what?!
come on, people. come on, people now. 
i'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
well if i have any chance of getting kyle back, i have to get people to stop driving suvs!
you know, cartman, you may be stoked now, but i bet you're gonna find that withuot kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
no, no, i'm asking if there's a listing for broflovski in san francisco! they just moved there!
yeah. you're right. 
well i'm sorry. well it's just that i'm not jewish, and now th-
oh crap, ranger mcfriendly.
i noticed it on the computer this morning. look here.  this is the smug over south park. it's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
wow, eric. you sure are a great guy for doing this.
but... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
i will. you're really great for going to warn kyle, eric.
yeah, it's like, san francisco is more of a european city, like paris or milan.
i'm here, eric.
you must be nearing union square. did you see a fountain to your left?
wait, uhh, eh take your next right. you've got to start heading west.
harry, the smug from clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! get everyone inside!  god help us.
that's it! eric, hurry! somethin's goin' on out here!
being smug is a good thing. 
i'm totally tripping balls. i'm totally tripping balls.
come on, everybody! let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
yeah, i guess so.
don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 
okay you guys, check it out. 
yeah, lots of people like family guy.
hehaha, heh.
that's it? that's all they did?
what? what's the big deal?
yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
uhhh...
kyle, you're not being very sensitive.
let's all look at why muslims are upset:  first of all, in the muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what?  sex. good.  there's no sex until marriage in the muslim world.  now, this would be fine except that in the muslim religion you also can't... anybody?  jack off.  okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the muslim religion.  and what do we know about the places muslims live? they live in?  good, sand.  now put yourself in the shoes of a muslim. it's friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. there's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. well you know what? i'd be pretty pissed off too!
once again: we have just learned that the family guy episode featuring mohammad was only part 1 of a two-parter! and part 2 is going to air next week, with mohammad uncensored!
retaliation... oh my god. m'kay?
does this mean we don't have school all week?
(like what?)
dude, we can't go anywhere. they've shut down the airports and the buses.
to los angeles?
well good for them. they shouldn't! the writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
all right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! i don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the muslim people is real!
nooooo! 
i didn't come to stop you. i... i think you're right, cartman. i want to help you get the family guy episode pulled.
look, cartman, i don't know what's gotten into you, but... i i think it's pretty amazing. and i think it's real. you have to understand why i didn't believe you before.
it's a long trip, dude. you're gonna need help. we can try and get the episode pulled together.
i know. but just like you, i feel like i have to try. people can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
i got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
yeah! 
i'm set! let's do this!
we got six days to make it to los angeles. if we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
off the air? but... we're just going to try to get the mohammad episode pulled.
whoa whoa wait a minute!  this isn't what i signed up for! i like family guy. why do we have to get it off the air forever?
but that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. you should like that show. your sense of humor is just like family guy.
you unbelievable son of a bitch. you never cared about the muslim religion. or the safety of people in america. you just want family guy off the air!
what are you talking about?!
i can't believe i let you scare me into taking your side. you used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
no!  i am not letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
what?  cartman! 
kyle, stop it!
no!  aaaah!  aaaah! 
you son of a bitch! i won't let you win! you hear me?!
next week on south park: the race continues. cartman reaches the family guy studio and learns the shocking secret behind the family guy writing staff.
...and the battle between good and evil is finally waged...
if we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this.
you just want family guy off the air...
kyle, stop it!
i doubt it! i'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to fox network to demand that that episode be pulled.
what is it regarding?
o...kay, but if you've got a problem with family guy, you'll have to wait in line.  that little boy over there has an appointment to try and get family guy off the air altogether. 
how come your head ain't in the sand? 
i hate family guy.
not nicely.
cool, man.
isn't that like, terrorism?
i could do that.
i'm a pretty bad kid.
i stole the head off a statue once.
you got it, man. you got it. 
all right, let's get this over with. 
oh, poor kid.
little boy, will you talk to the family guy writing staff? if your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
take this noble child over to the family guy offices. if he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the mohammad episode after all.
what was that?
are you... sure? they're working on a new episode right now.
all right, i'll take him back. follow me, little danny.  you must be excited. not many people get to meet our writing staff.
well, here we are. danny, the family guy writing staff.
they're manatees.  gretchen and flubber are from the gulf of mexico. tinker, pete and lucy are from the caribbean sea.
whatchoo talkin' 'bout, willis?
when fox censored the image of mohammad last week, it also meant that the mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. it made the manatees very upset. pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. he-here, i'll show you.  keith?  all right all right, put it back in!  manatees are very ethical writers. either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.
that isn't gonna work on them.
don't you know anything about manatees? they're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
let me out of here, kid! why are you doing this?
cartman!
you fat sun of a bitch!
shut up!  you shut your fucking face, man!  did it work? did you scare the network into pulling the episode?
cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
then why are they refusing to write? i agreed to show mohammad uncensored! i did what you asked! what do you want from me??!!
i gotta hurry! 
i did it. i... am... god!!!
cartman!!  you fucking fatass!
that kid and i had a long talk! i told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
you are not killing family guy!!
there's still time to tell the network president you're full of crap! 
get out of my way or i'll kick your ass!
ow. quit it!
ow. quit it, kyle! bleh. kyle! 
ow. quit it!
no more timeouts, fatass!
time out! time out! time out, kyle! ay! ay!
what manatees??!! 
sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
ah... i don't know who to listen to!
you can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
yes, people can get hurt. that's how terrorism works. but if you give into that, doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. do the right thing here.
i wish that was good enough, but if you censor out mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
yes! 
thank you, class. excelsior! 
pass it to me, cartman?
hang on. i'm going to do something killer.  god damnit, stop it, kyle!
just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! it's getting late!
we know. 
he's half man and half bearpig
don't worry! we can stop him! bring everyone you can to my manbearpig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! 
oh jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
i can get you all excused from school. 
we're trapped in here!
hello, help!
(what are we gonna do??)
me??
a-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. e-everyone take a different direction.  oh man, we're in big trouble here.
cartman?? cartman, you see anything??
cartman, you okay??  you need help??
maybe we should go for it.
why?
cartman's right. first rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
no, we'll stay here too. if we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
they saw us on the tour.  dude, where do you keep going, cartman?
let's just try to sleep. maybe help will come tomorrow.
c-cartman?
dude, what are you doing?
dude, get away from me!
naw, i f- i feel kind of bad for him. i don't think he has any friends.
no, it's cartman. something's really wrong with him. 
oh my god.  cartman? dude, can you hear me?
maybe we should get out first. see if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
cartman?
i can't keep carrying him, dude! i've got no strength!
what the hell is that?  oh my god. 
kenny! here, take my hand!  hurry kyle, the water's rising!
car... cartman! you've gotta swim! kick with your legs!
yes you can!
i need your help!
we need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
dude, did cartman just crap treasure?
hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our smuggler's den photo room.
yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. all in all, i'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.
you made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! you son of a bitch!
well, my work here is done. i've killed mbp, and now i must save the world from something else. maybe i'll make a movie. a movie starring me. then people will take me super-serial. 
eric, why would you do such a thing?
you know that's not the point!
that's very naughty, eric.
i know. i know he's out of control. but... you don't know what it's like.  i'm sorry. it's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  he just never listens.
it's not him, it's you, eric.  i don't know what to do with you.
it's time to call nanny 911.  we've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis.  parents of america, help is on the way!  tonight...
this eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
it's time for nanny stella to show eric cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! 
yes. i think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.
and you must be eric.
hold on, mrs. cartman. there are going to be some rule changes around here, eric. first of all, no video games until chores are done.
i'm serious. let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
right. then i'm going to have to take it. 
come on.  this video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed.  eric, no! this is not acceptable! 
all right, that's it!  you're going to time-out! 
whenever you are naughty, eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
it's the time-out stool. you can't get down until the time is up.
eric, you have to stay in time-out!
come on, you don't have a choice.
eric, you need to listen to me.  this is very important. i am getting down to eye level with eric so that i can talk to him on his level.  eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. all right?
all right! i've dealt with this before! we just need to use psychology on him!
eric, can i just talk to you for a quick second? why are you so angry?
is this about more than your video game? are you feeling angry at me because you think i'm here to change your life?
and you're feeling like i have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
see this? you have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. what else are you feeling, eric?
me? well, it's because i love children, like you.
oh, i just never had kids.
it... just... didn't happen.
what kind of  monster would-
so the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
see i'm not looking at the child, i'm not acknowledging the child, i'm just letting the child know i'm not interested in him.
see the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. because everything he does gets a response from you.
tsst.
don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. let, let him know we are having a conversation.
tsst.
dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. i just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know i am dominant.
tsst.
i think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. he's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
go on, take your son for a walk.
see once again, i am the one going for a walk. it's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
tsst.
don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 
here, why don't you try it now? take your son. 
good. just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. the child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
tsst. 
it is important to understand that dogs run in packs. and one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
ahall right.
tsst.
okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. what i have done is i have brought over some kentucky fried chicken. 
i am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 
tsst.
i am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. now you eat the chicken. 
we won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
we need him to become relaxed and submissive.
oh no, now he's lying. you can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
see?
tsst.
tsst. 
tsst. 
wow, i have a lot to learn.
oh boy, park avenue! i'm rich! 
you can't stay here.
you'er not staying at my house either.
no, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
(fuck you.)
whoopie! g and r railroad!
who is your best friend?
what's my last name?
...but i hate you.
...should that really matter at a time like this?
this is bullcrap! mom'll break soon. i can outlast her.
oh eric, i'm so happy you're home.
look what i did, eric. i learned how to make sumie paintings. i had almost forgotten how artistic i was.
how is the painting going?
yup, just like you said he would.
well let's feed it.
this is more aggressive-dominant behavior. don't nurture it.
nooo, you're asking him a favor. don't ask a favor, dominate! 
you project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. i promise. shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
tsst.
tsst. 
tsst.
tsst. 
tsst.
sounds divine!
oh cesar, i'm so happy to have you in my life. 
kill your mom?
dude, have you lost more weight?
dude, don't kill your mom. that's not cool.
dude, we're not killing your mom.
where am i supposed to get a gun?
i'm not shooting anybody.
no, cartman!
oh! well how about i do everything?! how does that sound?! i'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  fine! i'll do it by myself!
wait. maybe i don't have the right to kill my mom.
she isn't an object you can own. she's a human being.
no, she's just... out to make you suffer!
the world doesn't revolve around me?
why eric, you made your own breakfast.
and you're studying before school?
oh, eric. i'm very proud of you.
i love you, sweetie.
no, not really. you're just a client. well, good luck to you. gotta go. 
eric, how would you like to go with me to see madame butterfly friday night?
well, what if i took you to kentucky fried chicken afterward?  and then we'll go to target and buy you a mega ranger.
yes, darling. you can have whatever you want. 
we're over here, by the cart. 
dude! we've been waiting forever!
if you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
(i think kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)
see where i am? it's this way. 
wow, look at all these people playing right now.
this is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
you bastard! 
don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  no! i don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  no! 
yeah? well this guy does it anyway!
what?? why?? why?!
mine too!
i've got better things to do.
i'm just gonna stop playing.
no.
so what's the p-plan?
i don't play world of warcraft.
yeah, but i'm playing hello kitty island adventure.
o-oh, o-oh, a-alright. all right then.
got it.
timmy!
hey fellas!  boy, this is neato, huh?
i got world of warcraft, like you said.
well, there's only like four races to choose from-
yeah, my mom says i have to be in bed at 9:30.
look! there he is!
he's targeting us.
ike, look out! 
that's it, screw this game!
no! nooooooooo!
dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
we don't have a choice, dude. that guy killed our characters 14 times.
we can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
boars?
dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
behold, the sword of a thousand truths.  we must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. let's just hope to christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.
(me too.)
hang on, i'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
15 agility.
hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. what if we run out of food?
yes hon?
that's übercool.
ready.
wait, i think i see him. yeah, yeah, he's here in goldshire.
what's the autolocate macro?
okay, right behind stan.
okay, he sees us...he's targeted us.
casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
no, ah, i'm an arcane fire mage.
cast on him again.
nn-oh my god! 
oh, jesus, he's got it bad! 
hurry dude!
damnit, mine's in the shop!  uh hey! eh help! stop!  please, it's an emergency!  nelson! nelson, i need to come over and use your computer! no, i d-i need to play world of warcraft! nelson!
you can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
what hon?
oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? 
dude, i'm almost dead.
okay. 
dad, no!  you killed my father. 
attack! 
they killed him! we can come out!
we did it!
yeah yeah.
(woohoo! oh man!)
i can't believe it's all over. what do we do now?
oh yeah.
who would take a d-dump in a urinal? it's such a s-senseless crime.
oh god, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
not yet.
will you shut up about 9/11!
because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
let's take a test sample: there's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
hey, fellas!
well, i heard that 9/11 was caused by president bush.
from eric.
well, l-uh, i mean, uh, you never know. uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. the government and the corporations headed by the jews that tear down 9/11.
goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
can i go now?
oh no...
okay, thank you, leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. okay, anybody else have anything for show and tell?
all right, eric, you can go next.
oh christ...
whoa...
me??!
when you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  how would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  oh you think that's funny, huh?! yeah, that's real funny!
eric, i have to take you to the principal's office.
i've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
i'm just doin' my job.
eric cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
come on in, eric. 
eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 
if anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
now eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. m'kay? it is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
ahem. me?
hey, kid, get outta there.
what?
it's right here. 
what? you can't just push me up against the-
aah!
and so this shape with four sides is what, class?
what are you doing?!
i don't think that's really necessary.
hey there, mr. wiener, whattaya know? do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  yes i do think so.
haaaah!
it's, it's... i just had it! 
i knew it! 
huh?
uhh, okay. 
i do. 
i need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  my little brother and his tea-
(reaaly??)
it's not cool! ike isn't old enough to understand.
"""stick it inside her and pee"""
dude, i really don't see a problem.
you guys don't understand! his wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! they pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
they sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
well they're doing it!
i got your love letter, and i wrote you one back. oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. 
oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
i don't need a hall pass. i'm a teacher.
look, just let us get back in-
we're going back inside!
bear mace??
oooooh!
"""ike, i long to feel your arms around me""?? miss stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?"
this is unbelievable.
oh god...
wow. i think i owe you one, cartman.
yes, i'm afraid it's true.
what?
all right all right, we'll make a report. jesus...
dude, my brother's in milan. there's nothing i can do.
how do you know that?
who's beth?
beth is my bitch. i put a whole crew together, brah. i'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! are you in?!
can we get going now, please?!
but what about me? i want to talk. 
she ran away; now she got to deal with the dawg, huh?
hey! you can't leave your car there!
can i help you?
who are you?
i think you should leave before i call the police!
yes?
do you mind keepin' it down?
hey!  uh i got 'em, dawg. 10-4!
ike, run! 
bear mace that guy! and that guy! 
don't move! don't move!
why couldn't you just leave us alone? all we wanted was to love.
ike!
hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.
no! don't do it!
biggie. smalls... biggie smalls...
fine!  then you do it, you're so tough!
prove it!
you're afraid to do it, too.
then do it, if you're not yellow! 
let's go. yeah, let's go!
he just said something about... summoning biggie smalls... 
biggie smalls?
all right, boys, i know it's halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
i can do it. it just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
wull what the heck? i'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
there you are, eric. what are you doing here?
when does it come out?
it's time for school
eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 
our students want to learn, mrs. garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
it's still three weeks.
now i, for one, think evolution is a bunch of bull crap. but i've been told i have to teach it anyway. it was thought up by charles darwin and it goes something like this:  in the beginning we were all fish. okay? swimming around in the water. and then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. so retard fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its  mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this.  retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... and then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you!  so there you go! you're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! congratulations!
yeah? you see? i knew that would happen.
eric, you're coming home right now!
it's almost bedtime. if you sleep then time'll go by faster.
oh god!
agh! that does it!! i am not waiting three weeks!!
dude you don't look so good, cartman.
well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
(what?)
do what?
no.
you'll die, retard!
yeah, i hate you, but i'm not going to help kill you.
i've got a date! i've got a date! my first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  oh boy, what'll i wear?!  hey everybody!
whoa!
eric, get out of there. 
now eric, this has gone far enough!  you need to learn to be patient!
go where?
well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
yeah...i guess it is...
i got it.  big tree. oval rock.
oh jeez! 
yeah, pound my monkey hole, richard! yeah, i'm a monkey all right!
can you... understand me?
my name is shvek. you are safe.
my friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
please be careful. you are frail.
ahh, nintendo wii. a primitive gaming device used in his time.
young man, you don't seem to understand.  your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.
we don't play videogames in our time. there's no such thing as a nintendo wii.
oh jumping jesus! 
eric, i have good news for you. we may have found you a nintendo wii.
it's rumored that there's one at the museum of technology at new new hampshire.
lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. but you... are special.
you lived in a time when a great event happened. a glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. now, the entire world is atheist.
we believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: the unified atheist league.
science damn you, unified atheist league!
no! 
hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  oh my science. 
it won't make a difference! this is the dawning of the sea otter! know this, time child! i shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
this is it. new new hampshire. we have risked much bringing you here, time child. 
don't let the time child out of your sight. he could try to run.
something is spooking the ostriches.
hold!  this is it, time child.  the old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. let's get what you want, time child, and get out of here.
all right, time child, we've filled our side of the bargain. now return with us to otter bay.
science damn you, time child!
we thought for sure you had died in the in the phobart plant.
tc, wait!
you gained the otters' trust?! were you wearing an information crystal?!
you've done a great thing, tc.  how can we repay you?
just send a maintenance guy to my room. i want this nintendo hooked up to my float screen now! 
uhh, what kind of output does this have? this is some ancient super-vhs output or somethin'. i can't connect it to your flaot screen.
it may be the future for you, but i can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.
tc? what's wrong?
bark bark. hello, eric. i have missed you.
my monvert's never looked so clean. 
there's nothing to do.

working, bark bark. access.
that was a great one! 
oh. okay, i guess.
hey!
whoa, wait wait! 
hello?  are you there?
no, no, i have me.  all right, all right, listen! listen to me carefully! you need to be patient!
it's me.
me you!
i'm you in the future! you have to be patient and wait for the nintendo wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
it's not kyle, it's you!
i'm trying to do you a favor, dumbass!! just listen to me!
but...  but you're here right now. 
huh??
but, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
aw damnit, just listen to me! if you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
no, you suck my balls!! just listen to me for one minute!
right before you left for butters' house, you drank a buncha ovaltine and put clyde frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
no, i am you, you stupid asshole!
the united atheist league is bombing the city! we're defenseless!
your answer to the great question is illogical!
forward missiles launched, sir!
but eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.
your teacher, the one called garrison.
i'll thell them... to call you back... oh... yeah...  garrison residence. can you call... back later, please?
an emergency?
i'm sorry, but mr. garrison has passed away. mrs. garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.
richard, come back, please!  well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! have fun mocking god in hell! you queer!
all right, eric. are you all set to go?
don't worry, my son. when you return to your time you will merge with your other self. it's all very zen.
yes. long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.
we unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
we explained that to you already.
goodbye, eric. i will mess you. squawk squawk
so long, eric. and tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. 
there you are, eric.
eric, you have to come home. you can't just wait here for that game to come out.
but, honey, it's only september. that...  nintendo wii doesn't come out for two months.
who are you talking to, muffin?
hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
hello? hello? i know what you're thinking! do not do it! you just need to be patient and wait the two months! do you hear me?!
dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
can we just drop this please? i don't wanna talk about it!
uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, stan.
it may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. so don't say it isn't a big deal.
that's easy for you to say, stan.
that doesn't mean i can just be fine.
"if you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. that's all. i'm not ""fighting"" anybody. "
good morning, students! how are we all feeling today?  i would like to share with you all my-
that, that words are like bullets. and if you give-
no, no, it's okay. he'll run out of steam here pretty soon. 
very well, mr. nelson.  stacey, go ahead and send in eric cartman.  eric, mr. nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
you know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
you see? no matter what you say, i'm still standing.
no matter how you act, i can rise above it!
he, he, he didn't get to me. i was i was just i wast just joking
"""hello, fatso!"""
now you know how it feels.  you didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?
dude, are you sure you wanna do this? apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
students, i am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.
aaaa! ow! ow! okay!  okay, you win!
ung-cle!
caroline, don't go into the light!
thanks, dude.
is this all you brought us here to see?
butters is staying over tonight?
hey, fellas! 
yeah.  i finished my chores so i came over a little early.  hey! are you guys all sleepin' over too?
don't you think it's a little strange that cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
i mean, that if-
so what do you wanna do first, eric? you wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
but, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
yeah, and i'm exhausted. if you are not sleepy yet, i have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
what'cha do to butters this time?
dude!
dude, how is putting butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
no dude, that makes you gay!
you put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
yeah huh!
(ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)
you are now.
doesn't matter. you're gay now.
nono wait. i i know how you can reverse it, cartman.
the only way you can cancel it out is to get butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
yeah. then it cancels out the gay polarity.
help me, i thinking i'm falling in love with you... 
whoa, hey eric.
a surprise? what is it?
oh boy!
y-yeah!
oh, okay! 
how come uh, i can't see?
oh uh, ho yeah.
hey. hey wait a minute. this ain't a trick, is it? why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
well okay!
butters!
whoa boy! camp!
what are you talking about, fatass?
you figured that out, huh?
except for us.
and all the people we tell.
because it's really, really funny.
like what?
that isn't funny.
well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
okay. we won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
okay, my turn. 
where's what?
what the hell are you doing, cartman?!
knock it off! i don't have your stupid picture!
i don't have it!
shut up!
so you say you were robbed. 
if it's a photo, what's the big deal? why don't you just print out another one?
okay, what is the picture of?
well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
yes?
you were sucking somebody's penis. 
...i see.
well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
this is just as much your fault, butters! bradley is your accountabilibuddy! that makes you accountabilibuddyable. both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  right. for having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!
eric? what's the, what's the matter? 
sweetie, shhh, tell mommy what happened.
oh, now why would he do that?
what is the picture of, eric? 
ohh, that's nice.
oh, there there, sweetie. it'll be okay. these things happen.
it's okay, eric. i'll have a talk with kyle's mother.
don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
you have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. mrs. broflovski assured me that kyle doesn't have the picture.
she talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
she said she was sure, eric.
well, eric, there's nothing more i can do about it.
nono, we're fixing you!
okay eric, jesus, calm down. you can go first.
he isn't actually going to show everyone...
wait. now i am confused.
dude.
eric, what the hell is this?!
"uh, eric cartman? we got an emergency message from your mother?  ""do not show picture. kyle didn't have it after all. found it under your desk."" she said you'd know what that means, m'kay? "
all right, students, let's take our seats. apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
so today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
what do you think happens if you do have it?
i'm clean! i knew i didn't have any stupid lice! 
okay, kids, today we're going to review some civil war history. who can tell me what year the war started?
ohhhhh.
that doesn't matter, it's over.
it's being kept confidential! there's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
god did! when he killed my wife! 
yeah, come on! we're gonna find out sooner or later.
you know what? i'll bet it was you!
this is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
you guys stop it! this isn't getting us anywhere!
yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
well i guess we're never gonna know. there's no way to tell.
yeah. right behind you. 
what's this about, cartman? 
that's retarded! you didn't come up with that experiment, cartman, you saw it in that movie, the thing!
you saw it in the thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
all right, fine. i'll do the dumb test.
everyone take a petri dish and a syringe. we need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
it doesn't prove anything!
ye-you guys, we'd better go. recess is almost over.
what the hell?! 
you were right all along, eric. it was kenny.
what? what are you gonna do to him?
you guys, wait. 
i... nothing.
you die he- 
(not guilty!)
you guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
wait a-wait a minute, what?
you had head lice?
me too.
all right, students, let's take our seats. everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and i know you'll all make him feel welcome. say hello to... baahir hassan abdul hakeem.
thank you.
okay. 
eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
eric, that's enough! not all muslim people are terrorists!
yeah?
what? no, i'm sick. 
dude, leave me alone.
what? why?
all right, all right. 
baahir hakeem.  born in chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... car, cartman, what is this all about?
over a hundred.
white stripes
what?
he told everyone in class today his favorite band was blink 182.
hello?
from what? who is this?
are you serious?
like what?
dude. 
dude, i just got an im from stan that they evacuated the school.
i guess so.
wuh what doesn't follow?
okay.
yeah. actually, there is.
what?  this is cia head, alan thompson.
what do you know?
i'm the head of the cia! you can tell me!
look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
i will have you arrested for-!
hello?
huh? who.
prepare yourself. we detonate the bomb... within the hour.
so then maybe you're wrong.
yeah. i cross-referenced his myspace page with realtor.com. his parents moved into that green house on janice street.
yeah.  what is that?
god damn it cartman!
the call is going through now, sir.
this is cia head alan thompson. we spoke before about the- 
well, we've just arrived in your town.
yes. there's a suitcase nuke in ms. clinton's snizz.
that's right. it's controlled by a remote detonator. we have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
we're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
they claim they don't know anything about an attack.
this is getting us nowhere. if he knows anything, he's not saying.
what are you going to do?
he should be at school!  hey!
wuh-what detonator are you ta-
i don't know anything about a-  aawwwwgh  stop it! really!
what are you going to do to my wife?!
we told you: we don't know.
did he just inject himself with apple juice?
i mean it! stop! that is disgusting! where is your mother?! 
hallo? hallo baahir. where are you? who it but-ters?
ogh! you filthy little rapscallion!
all right, where? we'll send our people in.
you're not going alone.
whoopee! i captured another one of your pieces, baahir. 
oh hey eric.
the what?
hey, i was about to win!
get in the van! 
i'll do it! i'll check out ms. clinton's snizz.
you called and warned the government of our plans! what you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! we were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of america could attack!
do you really think muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
america had other enemies before the muslims, you know. who is america's oldest enemy?
before that.
before that.
before that! i am talking about the oldest threat to america! the greatest enemy america has ever known!
yeah. it just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. because, actually, most of the world hates us.
really?
...you didn't save everyone, i did! you were just out harassing muslims!
...maybe. 
...that is so missing the point.
the-that's not the right way to look at it, i-
no! ...not... not like you're saying.
awwwww.
you know so little! 
ahh, don't you think that's-
smile! 
"you boys make me sick! you're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! i am assigning all of you weekend homework! you are going to read hemmingway's book, ""the old man and the sea""!"
(what the hell are we going to do?!)
we don't?
no. there's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
we looking work, sí.
yeah.
sí, la samuraisia.
dude, that is awesome. i had no idea you could do that.
they'd better be done with the book reports! school starts in 15 minutes!
sí.
all right!
dude, we're totally fucked now!
yeah. i feel pretty good about it. i finished my whole book report and, i got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the u-haul. 
hello, class. here's my little desk , my nice lil chalkboard. 
but listen, i am not going to just rush into a relationship with allyson. i'm a late-in-life lesbian. so i need to play the field for a while, right?  oh i'm so happy.
yeah. i think i'm actually learning something. 
spare some change?
(yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
really?
gather 'round and witness the glory as eric cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
excuse me, this isn't exactly what i had in mind!
oh! aww.
i don't know.
spare any change, sir?
he did?
well, i... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
kyle, what were you thinking?
no, please. i don't have any change. honest i don't. i don't have any- 
come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
over here!  jump down! go! 
(dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
there's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. w-we can't get to them.
jump them?
oh, shut up, cartman. all you did was jump over one homeless guy.
it's dying.
get to evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! i'll be all right!
look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
cartman? eric cartman? the kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
heard about it? they said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
kyle, knock it off! we're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless cartman can jump!
all right, hit it.
california
in the city
"city of brentwood
they take really good care
of all their homeless"
in the city
oh glen! we made it!
cha-a-ange?
in the city
eughuhuh.
honestly, i don't know what you see in this, kyle.
cock! 
here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. 
cocknut! augh... stupid shit!
no. cocknose!
oh, a-i'm sorry.  my... son thomas has tourette's syndrome. 
asshole asshole.
yeah.
yeah! 
hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
it started about four days ago, doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
oh...
"oh dear... i was checking out the internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called ""tour, tourette's syndrome""?"
that doesn't seem likely. tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
...on the other hand, tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.
we don't know very much about tourette's i'm afraid. but we will give your son all the help we can.
don't worry, young man. we'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
ohohh, that's awesome. thank you. faggot! 
dude, you'd better watch it. the principal's right over there. 
"he's the luckiest kid in the world. if i could say ""shitballs"" to the principal i'd be sooo happy."
he's faking.
you do not have tourette's syndrome, fatass!
who cares about saying whatever you-?
grrhh, whatever. 
okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
-when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?
ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
all right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?  now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
will you knock it off already?!
no! up yours, fatboy!
"do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  ass! ass!  we aren't ""faking"", young man. trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass.  piss! piiiss!"
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i said i'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
oh, thank you eric.
well i think we can all put this behind us now.  piiiss out my aaass!
but now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to tourette's syndrome. it all started when i received this touching letter from a brave little boy in colorado.
living with tourette's: the eric cartman story. this saturday on dateline nbc.
finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  goddamn jews! suck my ass barf! 
what's this about you going on live television on saturday?!
cartman, there are people in the world who really have tourette's syndrome. this isn't funny!
...scotch?
you are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about jewish people! i won't let you do it, cartman!
it's not a game, you derelict! and this isn't scotch! it's apple juice! 
what did you say?
you aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
the spokesman for tourette's? oh no...  cock!
"if i could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television i would be sooo happy."
uhit's okay, eric. we understand your illness, m'kay?
eewwww!
uh hey eric!
wuh who are you talking about?
you... you and your cousin touched wieners?
i didn't say that yes i did but why? oh! stop it! 
is there a problem, sweetie?
well all right eric. well good luck on dateline tonight.
tonight, an inside look at tourette's syndrooome. i'm chris hansen. mmh. i'm chris hansen.
why not?
why don't you have a seat?
go ahead and take a seat.
take a seat, right over there.  what are you doing here?
but you are doing the show.
well of course you can't control what you say. you have tourehhtte's.
why don't you take a seat?
have a seat.
take a seat, right over there.
five minutes, kid.
aw, not again.
surprise, fatass!
take a look, fatass! i beat you! you aren't going on dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
what?
no, i- i beat you!
mr. marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. 
this is so retarded, cartman. you've got everyone believing your stupid story.
this is hawk eyes. we've set up the net and we're standing by. 
just admit you were lying, cartman, so that everyone can go home!
... i don't want the code name blackie.
this is fucking retarded!
yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! now just pay up and stop being stupid!
this is faggot. go ahead.
okay, that's enough.  everybody! cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
uh, i got somethin'! i got it!  it's uh... oh jeez i thnk it's a leprechaun!
fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
wow.
you lads don't know what you're doin'. i need to deliver an important message! there's goin' to be an attack!
dude.
i thought i did. 
oh,hello eric.  kyle, your friend is here.
get out of here, cartman, we're eating dinner!
doing what?
just get out of here!
ah hey now kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
whatwhatwhat?!
gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. it's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
from what i've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place mr. cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.
you have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. if after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. next case! 
waaahaa!
he's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
hey, he's here. 
let's just get this over with!
god damnit!
there's no time! you need to come with us right now! 
we aren't going to hurt your little friends. we just need information.
glad i picked you up, kid. it's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
you goin' to washington to visit family?
i've got unfinished business. you go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  make no mistake, kyle. before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
all right, we might as well show it to them.  god-dammit, tom.
you okay, kid?
man, i do not want to meet the kid that dreamt those things up.
i'm sorry, sir. that information is classified.
cartman??
who the hell are you?!
get him out of here!
dude, you did make a deal... 
theee conference room is which way? 
"i didn't ""bail,"" i got picked up by the government!"
cartman, do you even know what's going on? we went to imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
okay, fine. you know what? let's just get it over with!
no, i'm serious! i wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
they're raping all of us! whoaho! oh it hurts! they're raping us and it huuurts! waaagh!
goddammit cartman, will you stop wasting time? i wanna get this over with!
let's just do it! 
everyone to the main hall now! go!
everyone to the main hall now! 
clear!  i'm sorry. he's gone.
i'm sorry, young man.
well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
he's gone, little boy.
charging.
clear.
we have no choice. terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. there's no other option.  we have to nuke our imagination. 
stan?
cartman, what's happened?
no, i mean what happened at the pentagon?!
arh!
cartman, what is going on out there?! what happened to stan?!
wwait, what do you mean? stan's in danger?
gaa haa!
red suit, white beard... ssssanta! 
this of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous cartman v. broflovski ballsucking case.
stan? stan?? 
i'm going to try to save stan and butters from getting nuked!
no, i don't! the decision was overturned. 
yeah, that leprechauns were real! and the government just declared they aren't technically real, so i was right! it's over! i don't have to suck your balls!
sector 2? 
what?
so it'd be all right.
all right, enough! keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
missile launch in one minute.
sector 2? 
abort the sequence. 
awwww 
cartman, don't!
oh my god.
i'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
that's true. you did.
ahhh shit.
i can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. you want me to teach you boys how?
but... but this is real.
they're gonna do it!
don't put this all on me, kyle!
go stan!
what are you doing?! the video crowd is starting to boo! 
mom, will you get dad out of here?
how was that cheating!
fellas! fellas! they're gonna do it!
goddammit! god dammit! 
i don't know. ih it's like a girl thing. they won't let anybody see the list but them. 
you guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? girls make dumb lists all the time.
you're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
you don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
(they didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
you guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
what??
that's not for boys to look at! it's a secret girl list and you can't see it!
i'm not...  telling! and anyway, i'm not the list keeper, nelly is! and nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
well, i guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
screw that, dude! we're guys. we can outthink them.
neato!
o-kay!
ow! what'dja do that for?!  hey, what's your problem, asshole?! 
bail, bail! 
they sure don't.
you think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! pay attention! 
give that back you dirty buttholes! 
ah! look at that! i'm hotter than you, fatso! 
oh, so big deal, guys! do you feel better now? clyde's the best looking kid in the class. and then token and stan, and last is francis, cartman, and...  me?
no way.
cartman, lay off! you're next to last.
kyle, come back here! 
hrrgh! 
butters, that's not cool, man.  he can't help how he looks. 
line
well, there's no doubt about it. those tonsils need to come out.
it's a very simple operation. we'll just put you to sleep, eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
oh, i thought you were a tough kid! you're not scared of hospitals, are you?
well then i guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
what do you say, champ? think you can tough it out?
poopsiekins, wake up. wake up, honey.
that's right, you did it, poopsiekins!
i'm so proud of you, eric.
oh, here's the doctors now! hi, doctor.
...what!?
during the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. a mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with hiv. it was a one in a billion fluke.
not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes aids. we are very sorry.
oh, my poor little baby!
oh god!  oh no!
we're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, eric. for starters, i think i owe you some ice cream. 
oh, oh, my baby has hiv!
how ya doin', eric? you know, i think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have aids, i ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
poor kyle. he's really taking it hard.
no, you're not going to die, eric. aids isn't as big a deal as it used to be. there are advances in treatment and-
we are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with hiv. 
the italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
i'm afraid aids benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. aids was more the '80s/'90s disease. it's all about cancer now. 
with all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for aids tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little eric markman.
it's all right, we got somebody better: jimmy buffett!
"hello everyone. i wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
aidsburger in paradise!
aidsburger and it ain't nice!"
"a little boy in south park
dyin' of aids in the cold dark
how he got aids i haven't a clue.
wastin' away again because of aids and stuff
how are we all feelin' tonight?"
ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
fuck you mom, i have fucking aids!
oh dude, was that yesterday? we forgot.
well, did... elton john sing a song for you?
i'm sorry. i'm. i'm really. cartman, i f-i feel really bad for you. honestly.
i do. 
i'm sorry. i gotta go home. 
he does feel bad for you, cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
not me! that's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
okay, but... what are you going to do?
i just uh... well i don't know if i should be helping you make kyle look silly.
i know, but are you sure kyle has to be taught a lesson?
oh yeah, uh-well i guess that's true.
wow, you really know what you're doing.
kyle? kyle!
i'm gonna kill you, cartman!
...oh...
what did you do?!
then why did butters say he helped you sneak into my room last friday night?! 
tattle-tale?! do you know how serious this is?!
aaaaaaa! 
is that true, eric? did you give kyle aids?
did you infect kyle with the hiv virus, yes or no?!
that's right. i think you owe kyle an apology.
you're sorry for what, eric?
a tattle-tale?! he infected me with aids!
see? he's tattling again. he hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
i'm going to break everything that you own! 
what's that supposed to mean? kyle?  kyle, no! i apologized, kyle!
there is no cure, you asshole!
what hope?!
you're lying!
magic johnson?
so what?!
you better! 'cause if you don't find a cure for hiv, i will break your xbox!
my god...
los angeles. okay, uh i have a two o'clock flight. that would beee... $400 each.
...aids? wow, that's really... retro. but ah i'm sorry. i- i just can't give away free seats.
are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but aids i d-. heh-hey mitch? do we have any aids patient policies?
we're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. what kind of cancer did you say you have again?
i'm so sorry
hm, i don't know. these days i think i'd rather have aids than cancer.
don't. touch me.
you boys both have the virus? are you sure?
will you stop it with that?! what part of this is funny to you?!
what part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
then stop saying you're not just sure, you're hiv-positive!  this isn't funny, aids isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
knock it off! right now! this isn't funny! at all!
yes!!
i suppose we could try to distill magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. but it's very risky.
wait a minute... yes... yes, take a look!  the cash particles have completely replaced all the hiv in kyle's blood!  boys, you just found the cure for aids.
these two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. and so, to honor these boys , here is... jimmy buffett!
"cureburger in paradise!
cureburger. there i said it twice!"
i'm still breaking your xbox. 
this is important, stanley!  you boys should care about this stuff.
ron, i'm standing in south mark, colorado, where britney spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. 
a hundred thousand dollars?
it's gotta be the komfort inn. it's the nicest hotel in south park. cartman, go get your camera.
yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
mm-my cousin's in florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. m'kay? re-really reeeally high. okay?  probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. hm'kay? tha, that was probably bad.
yeah, this is not gonna work.
(all set.)
do you feel anything?
(okay.) 
(what?)  (where'd she go?) 
(you fucking asshole!)
(what the fuck did you do that for?)
(what?! no! what are you doing?!)  (you fuckers!) 
yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? they've been outlawed.
we've gotta keep this away from him.
mr. kitty, shhh!  damn it!  shhh, mr. kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  what?!  it's the neighbor cat. he hasn't been caught yet.  no- no, mr. kitty. i know you like rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  i can't hide anymore cats, mr. kitty.  i'm in trouble enough as it is.  all right, all right, fine. 
i couldn't stay away. curse your rockin' tits!
please! open the door.  they say you are hiding cats.
you don't understand  my little nishka,  she has nowhere else to go.
but they will find him.
oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
(woooooh! woooooh!) 
dude, we've got a big problem. cartman says kenny is really messed up.
what are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
(me too.)
and you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
yeah.  he's getting... really high on life. 
students, quiet please, m'kay? as you may or may not know, today is canada appreciation day.
hello, i am stephen abootman, president of the world canadian bureau. do you ever stop to think how important canada is to the world? right now, i would like all students of canadian descent in this school to stand up.  just look at all these fine canadians in your school. see how diverse they are. when you think of canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?
guys, i'm really worried about my brother.
huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
"you think that's bad? remember the time i sang ""la cucaracha"" for paul mccartney?"
they said we have to give them money that we make on the internet.
we'd have to put something up on the internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"i said what what? in the butt
i said what what? in the butt
i said what what? in the butt
i said what what? in the butt
you wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
you wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
you wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
let's do it in the butt. o-kay!"
take a number and wait with everyone else.
and the star wars kid.  and the internet sensation cute sneezing panda.  and there's dramatic look gopher. 
huh, mere peanuts. chocolate rain has done gangbusters. theoretically, i'm a millionaire.
thought i forgot about you, gopher?!  ughhh, my brains. 
yeah. everyone thinks i'm a homo now.
ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? anybody else? 
any other volunteers, perhaps?
all right, all right, fine. eric, you lead the class.
you're not the teacher, fatass.
eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
after leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. whatever you did really worked on them.
these kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?
that sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. how much will you pay me?
you're not an awesome teacher!
the only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of garrison's desk! and you know it!
(yeah, that was my idea.)
do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! a little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? they are going to fucking murder you! 
this may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! i want you to welcome... eric cartmanez
what the hell is thiiis?
mah penis!  stop, penis! come back here!
yeahhhh.
getting into college? maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! fuck you! 
hey, i don't wanna be called a cheater!
this is bullshit. i don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
ow. that hurt my brains.  oww.
hey, i walked out of your class, teacher. look, i don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
sure thing, mr. c.
aaaah! 
you cheated!
fuck you, man, you can't do that!
i know what you're trying to say, but i still don't agree with it. 
huh?
i thought that... well maybe i can give cheating a try.
"""i mis-interpreted the rules."""
"""i mis-interpreted the rules."""
"""i mis-interpreted the rules."""
come back here, penis!  there you are! got you!  hey, you're not my penis.  ogh!  there it goes! stop you!
the answer to #27 is 5.
man, what's the point?  what's the point of any of this? 
there isn't any point to all this. i won't be going to college. i'm pregnant, all right? i just found out, and eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
no. i'm catholic. i think abortion is wrong.
that cheating is good?
i don't know, mr. c.
students, i want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. the school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  the test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.
i knew it man! you made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
shut up, man! you reyally screwed us all!
yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
we would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the white people method. mr. cartmanez! 
thank you, pioneer paul.  all right, kids, this is a big place, so i want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
(no, i'm partners with craig) 
naw, i'm with wendy.
i hate you, remember?  you wanna be partners, jimmy?
eric, partner with butters.
hold butters' hand, eric! 
all right, let's head in. 
no.
why howdy, partners, i'm the town gunsmith. you see, in our time it's pretty violent. see them holes in the walls? that's so we can put rifles through to protect us from injuns.
do you see any indians?
oh, that's cool.  well come on, eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
oh no! i'm not sneakin' out! i'll get in trouble!
teacher said i can't let go till we're back on the bus!
i'm not lettin' go!
no, eric! 
this is not the time for that!
well, that's your problem!
no! 
we should get back to pioneer village, that's what we should do!
sister, you don't know the half of it.
check it out, dude, i'm a space man! space man, yehesss!
what are you whoofelin' at? 
whoa! 
yeheah, we're wired up!
th-that's it, eric. we have to be gettin' back!

yeppir! 
we're not telling anybody! i don't wanna get in trouble! and i didn't have a super fun time anyways.
yeah, well, i guess that's kinda true.
what?! they called the cops?!
oh my god, the police are looking for us!
we're gonna get it now!

you said they wouldn't notice we were gone. you promised. 
no.

jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
that looks dangerous.
oh gosh in heaven.
whoa!
i'm gonna fall! 
i am so disappointed in myself. teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and i was just supposed to look after my partner, and i blew it!
huh... 
let's do it!
copy that. what's the code, over. 
yeah, it sure has.
or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
get your hands behind your head!
let go or else i'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
no! 
aaaah!

i seriously didn't mean it.
what? uh where are you going, eric?
by, by my, by myself?
so wait. that's it? what about the chinese invasion?
thank you mr. garrison.  fellow students, october is awareness month for one of the leading causes of death among women. a terrible disease that takes the lives of american women every day. i'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  an estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
is there a problem?! because breast cancer isn't funny! breast cancer is killing people!
this is a serious issue, eric! what you're doing is very offensive!
eric, stop being offensive.
no you aren't!
wendy, you need to calm down. you're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  dude, i'm on fire today!
what is your problem?! breast cancer isn't funny!
you'd better shut up  or i'll make you shut up!
i'm gonna kick your ass! that's what i'm gonna do!
that's right, i'm gonna kick your ass!
you think you're tough?
i'll smack the shit out of you!
after school! we fight after school! you got that?!
that's right!
as soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! and you better be there.
she is pissed off.
hey, check it out. she's totally staring you down.  she sure seems confident. you should probably go easy on her, dude. you don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
yeah, heh.  if you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
what?!
what?
if you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
no! if you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
yes you did! you just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
i don't want an excuse! i'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
ah i hope not! i wanna see eric kick the crap out of her! 
what?!
you really think that's gonna work on me?!
you can't bribe your way out of this!
no you don't.
you don't get it, asshole!  there is nothing you can do to stop this fight! i am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! i am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
that's right.
jesus christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
you fucking suck so hard!!
what are you doing?! 
ew! 
oh my god!
no!
you are so pathetic!
wendy it isn't fair!  i ate my underwear for you! nooo!  yo, what's up dawg?
what?
yeah?
i can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
really?
dude, there's nothing i can do about it.
i totally can't see the fight, dude. i have detention after school.
eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
welcome to detention, m'kay? you are here until your parents come and pick you up. use your time to study. 
eric. hey eric.  eric, wha-what's goin' on? everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' wendy.
but some people think you crapped on teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
then why'd you crap on garrison's desk?
"that's what i said. i told everyone outside, ""cartman ain't scared of fightin' wendy! he'd do it if he could!"""
before school starts. everyone's gonna get there early.
you don't understand. he said horrible things.
wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. haven't we taught you that?
you're very sweet. thank you again. come on, muffin. 
man it's almost time for school to start an' wendy still isn't here.
here she comes! 
you know i can't fight you!
i can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
aw man. 
very nice, clyde. okay, we have time for one more report before recess. who'd like to go?  okay eric. 
you unbelievable bastard. you beat me but you won't stop.
why?!  why are you doing this to me?!  why won't you just stop?!
what? 
she's coming! she's coming!
but wendy's coming to fight you.
all right, let's do it!
i don't care! 
shut up and fight! 
eh somebod - somebody call the principal! 
dude, we never thought you were cool.
yeah, nothing's changed. our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
well yeah.
what?
(hey dude, i like to shave my balls.)
(yes they do.)
oh jesus, there's another one!  another pan flute band! have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
i gotta get home for dinner.
god!
ohhh neato, it's one of those peruvian pan flute bands. stan, go out and stand with them. i can get a shot. 
you guys! you guys, check this out: i saw another peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
so? so i just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy cds?
two hundred dollars?
yeah, why not? we get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music cds on my computer.
but where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
...fine.
craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
craig, we have chosen you to join our peruvian flute band!
there's a reason they're everywhere, craig: because they make bank! we just need your money to buy instruments and make some cds.
you guys never hang out with me. you never invite me to do stuff. but now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
all right guys, just like we rehearsed it. you ready craig? all right, let's jam!
very cultural, yes.
ya see, craig? 
hey, you guys can't play here. we were here first. 
god damn it!
jesus christ!
go, go! 
we we speak english!
do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  because you're always doing stuff like this. you're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. that's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
you guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to miami with no way home except to take down the country of peru, and i'm being a dick?
this is fun. let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. it just keeps getting better and better.
(yeah!)
you just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
um i think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
hey, hey, look at this. 
it might be a way out, craig!
i know, a-and look. 
and then the guinea pigs killing people.  and then... 
i have no idea.
hear that? it sounds like water.
wow. 
craig, dude, wait up.
...nope.
what of your prophecy now?! nothing can stop me!  craiiig!  no! how did you get here?!
the guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  and people all over the world learned to support their local peruvian flute bands, and buy their cds. for they protect us from the guinea creatures. as for me, i was returned home by homeland security.  my parents were sooo happy.  i realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  we are but players on the stage of life. and i also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 
o-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. hey obama! hey obama! 
oh!  ugh, god damn it! obama said things would be different! that sonofabitch lied to us! i knew i should have voted for mccain!

with all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.
together at school again. what a special day.
ah, shit.
what? are you crazy?
what's so bad about hanging out with me?
hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!
hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
well, i had to see it to believe it!
'at's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
look, guys.  the world is changing. we can't fight it, we have to change with it. i've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  and if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks butters is way cooler than any of you.
"that's right. you know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. there's things we're all good at. and we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
true, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
he was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball"
"some kids think i'm strange 'cause i like studying for an exam
but i don't let that bother me, because it's who i am. "
do what you want, don't have restraint.
"m'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in ""x = y + 1"". mkay, and then it says we hit command-y to bring up the menu screen."
no, i'm on the japanese side.
m'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  okay kids, i'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. uh, just keep entering the calculations; i'll be right back, m'kay.
but there is. you guys gotta believe me. first there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. they have fangs and drink blood and everything.
really? do you think that's best?
all right!  if i don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
sorry, eric, but i am a vampire now, and i can no longer survive on human food. and if someone must die so that i can feed, i choose thee.  hm, wonder which side i'm supposed to do it on, hm. probably doesn't matter. 
i can't do it. ah, i- i can't do it!
i'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. it makes me wanna... 
what's going on?
oh dear.
line
yeah, it's just so astounding.
well, so, w-who is she?
oh, no. oh, geez!
it's true! ask anybody in fifth grade. tammy warner is a total slut!
w-well, we've heard that she's...
(huh?)
(woo-hoo! woo-hoo-hoo! yeah, hey, yay!) 
(thanks.) 
(of course, dude!)
(no, i'm not young and i want a b.j.)
and be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
(a purity ring.)
(look at this. more dvds.) 
come on, kenny, this isn't you. we want you back, dude.
it's that ring. somehow, putting on that ring has turned kenny into a boring turd.
what? 
that's great stuff, boys. you like takin' the jonas brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
who the hell are these guys?  are they from dreamworks? goddamn eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
oh boy, i sure believe that, haha.  you just tried to ruin disney company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! haha.
and so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. this young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... for the world of oral sex is a world...
well, now we know.
and knowing is half the battle.
what's in here? 
who's the coon?
...yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
...dude, what?!
why do you care?
"oh. i uh... well i ah ah  i'm just... i'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" kyle. that's a hate word. and it's insensitive to butt pirates. anyway, what do you think about the coon, stan and kenny? do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  kenny?"
no! dude, i'm seriously! you're being a copycat! i'll sue you!  motherfucker!
you're a fucking douchebag! get outta here!
oh, hello sweetie. what did you do today?
aww, what happened, hun?
tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in south park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
but who exactly is... mysterion? 
well i, i think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? a, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
this artist rendition of mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.
if you have any idea about the true identity of mysterion, please call the 9 news hotline.
i don't have time for this.  fireworks are illegal in colorado, you asshole!  hey, he's got fireworks!
not really.
dude, what the hell?
yeah, so do i.
i don't know, it's just a cool costume.
how are you so sure mysterion is a boy?
he's all right! 
...an angel came to me and so i say to you: do not listen to the wall street brokers! for they are the ones that put us in this situation! fat cats with corporate greed! they are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! our responsibility is...
sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
you want something new every week, fatass.
my fault?
well eric did. 
relax, father maxi. what harm can one jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
i don't know... he's got a lot of support. it might be hard to even catch this jew. 
i can't just hide my whole life, butters. and besides, i have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
aww, come on!
oh god, that show is so dumb.
why do boys think farts are so funny? they're juvenile and gross!
we're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who phillip f-farted on.
oh boy!
dude, i was here first.
...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this queef sisters special!
now i'm just going to check for cysts.  awww! 
i guess so katherine.
eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! you know, women empowerment and the get-go. so we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
we're complaining to the canada network 'cause they put something really gross on tv!
i threw up on my way home.
oh what? so farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
wait a minute. i've got an idea.
robbed us of our innocence.
ohhhhh ohhhhh. 
oh. hey fellas.
my, my picture?
a disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. queefing has become an acceptable evil.
for instance, we have the sneezing unicorn.  and the resuscitator 
you are woman now, and you are free to queef.
that's it! i now pronounce you farts and queefs! 
oh, hey eric. i was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
sorry eric, but i really need to work, very much. i haven't written a good joke in over a week.
oh, well, sure. i've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. let's see... i was workin' on this: why does a squirrel swim on its back? to keep his -nuts dry.
ahb. a fireman and a p-p-polack are eating marshmallows when-
"...so the pope says, ""what are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"""
wow, thanks mom.  you might have saved my life.
you can check the freezer. there might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
wait a minute. fishsticks... fish. dicks.  ohmigod! it's so obvious. how did i never think of it before? 
alright, just run with me on this, eric. say eric, do you like fishsticks?
you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
well what are you, eric? a gay fish?
yeah yeah, let's do it to clyde.
eric and jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
yes. 
yes. 
ha you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
fishsticks? yeah, i guess so. 
yes.
alright, that does it! i'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! 
we know, cartman!
p-patent?
well, eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. i mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
"well you know i just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause i'm so fonny and stuff, so i was just all like, """"hey, papito, you like fishsticks?"" and my homeboy says ""yeah carlos"" you know, ""you're so funny!"" and then it just occurred to me. i said, ""oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!""  and this is how i came up with it, my amigos! "
motherfucker!
really?
aahhm, i don't know, eric. i really don't think i want to sign that very much.
well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, eric, i think i came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
well, you know, i mean, i basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
jimmy, that's messed up. we decided that day to write together. don't you remember?
sorry eric, but i've gotta write some jokes. unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
here's some fishsticks guys. i hope you like fishsticks.
is that... is that how it happened?
i'm... i'm sorry?
"i don't need anyone tellin' me ""play on words""! i'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!"
dude, get out of here! i'm peeing.
you know what, cartman? i believe you.
yes, i believe that you believe you helped write that joke. that's how people like you work! your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. and people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
but, i'm sure i helped come up with the joke. didn't i?
oh hey eric. just workin' on some jokes.
that'd be great! i've always wanted to work with you. you're really funny and you're totally not fat.
hello eric. have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
"right. and then i say, ""yeah."""
what is that?
and he's not fat at all.
thanks you guys!
thank you, thank you very much. well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. and ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it.  but today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. please welcome the comedy team of cartman and valmer.  hey guys!
it was just a-
well ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
yes ma'am. 
i see. and did you know that carlos mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? 
get my jet ready. looks like we got another inning to play. 
it's always been my dream to go on a national tv show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
eric, there's something i really need to know.
how do you live with yourself? you know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  but you just keep pretending. how do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! that's what i want to know!
how do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
well i just but i buh i was, gonna ebeh-
abebeh, abebebebebeah! we both came up with it together! you wanna know how it happened?!
oh boy! it's my best pal, eric!
i'm trying to write jokes. but i'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
ruh really? wow, you would help me even though i'm crippled. you are caring and not fat. 
eric cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.
eric! eric, you have to save us! an entire army of jew robots! 
you saved everyone from the jewbots, cartman.
wow eric, in-credible! too bad i'm a dick and i'm gonna take all the credit. su-su-suck it, bitch!
what?!
jesus eric, he's gonna kill you! you won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
what? i, i still don't get anything.
rih, r-r-really?
no heywaitwait, no!  well that sucks!
what are you talking about, dude?
somalia? where's that?
whoa.
wow, you know, cartman? that is an awesome idea. you should totally go to somalia.
no, i'm being totally serious. that is the best idea you've ever had. you should run away to mogadishu. you should go there right away. i'll even help pay for your ticket.
nono, you're right. somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. it's totally the pirate's life.
jews can't be pirates.
good morning, students. these are the morning announcements. teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next tuesday.  please inform your parents. the gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. and now for a special announcement:
at my house? why my house?
ahoy fellow club members. congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to captain cartman. all hands on deck! 
well, there's really not that many of us. we figured we should let him join.
fine, i don't wanna be a pirate anyways! 
yeah!
and your mom is okay with that?
neato!
ho! 
have a good flight. next, please? 
i see. you five boys are all booked through to cairo by yourselves?
oh jeez. unh i don't know if i can really go through with this.
yeah maybe we should think about this.
huh, who, you mean you?
no, i'm sick of it!
where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
oh. he-he says they're in there. 
mayasuk! hageha-aden! letka suwahater! 
yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. thank you. 
"""i don't know what the fuck this is!"""
"""take them out to the nearest european boat! show them we have children hostages!"" "
"""we will get a nice ransom for you!"" "
"""do it now!"" "
"""move!"""
i gotta sit middle 'cause i get motion sickness. 
you said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 
no it's not! you made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
"""we want 5,000 euros! you easily have that much on board!"""
"""we are going to start killing them! starting with the fat one!"""
"""we are growing impatient! give us what we want or they die!"""
"""the money first!""  ""go! get on the boat! move!"""
"""did they hurt you?"""
"""what is this?!"""
okay! 
"""hey! you can't order us around!"" "
have a good day! 
"what's ""port""?!"
"we'll kick your ass and rape your lass. somalian pirates we!
so with a yo ho ho!"
yo ho ho.
yee hee hee
somalian pirate we.
yo ho ho!
"we'll shoot you in the face with glee!
then we'll cut off your ears-"
somalian pirates we.
yo ho ho!
somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
my god, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! gentlemen, i want the president of the united states on the phone. we can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. we have to take them out where they live.
"""another american arrived on the bus!"""
breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in somalia. members of nato received word today that pirates have captured an american child and are demanding ten million euros for his safe release. u.s navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
no, fatass, i came to get my brother! we all have to get out of here! it isn't safe.
i know! i was lying then!
this isn't paradise and you know it! the people here are starving and dying! the whole world has used somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. even the fish here are radioactive!  cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
yeah, me too.
cartman, knock it off!
eric! hey eric. listen, we wanna go home.
me and ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in america. i mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. the pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. when you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
i hate it here and i wanna go home!! 
they never grow old because they die before they're 30!
alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!
clear.
all the time. 
guys, ike has gotten worse. i'm really worried about him. he says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
"i don't know. last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. he was screaming the name ""billy mays"" over and over again."
what?
dude, i don't even know who that is.
now you can eat all the chipotle you want , and still have underwear that sparkles and shines . order right now!
what?! are you serious?!
dude, why the hell would you do that?!
no, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
but, dude this doesn't make any sense. i mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
dude, i don't understand at all. i eat chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
"sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. and so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called ""purgatory."" it is a temporary plane of existence. it's neither heaven, nor hell. purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. and even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. and you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. all these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. and they aren't serving any drinks yet. it's like, a terrifying limbo."
hi, billy mays here with another fantastic product.
are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
so then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as chipotaway?
your mom... uses chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
and then takes you to chipotle, and buys you more?
what has michael jackson always tried to be?
go on by, michael. 
ignorant.
aww crap!
(son of a stinking bitch!)
so what?!
oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. i would eat it every day, except i-... 
how did you know-... look, it doesn't matter.  i'm just gonna have to give it up.
excuse me?
yeah!
woohoo!
it's okay, ike, you're going to be... okay.
awwwwwwww!
i'm a dork, and i deserve what's coming to me.  ow.
fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on butters for this time?!
oh boy, i sure am nervous.
dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. it's supposed to be special.
thank you! 
yep! i am founder and head ceo of the butters kissing company. just look at this. 
wow wee. 
cena slept with edge's girlfriend?
took hid drrr! 
yes! yehhehehes!
this is awesome!
this is it you guys! we know what our calling in life is now. tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
let's do this!

uh oh, here she comes now! it's bad irene! 
if you love juggernaut, irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! how you killed his child!
irene, no! why?
irene, you said you loved me!
good thing we made those changes to the seating.
backyard wrestling!
oh! sure, that works.
what dude? 
no way!
omigod! omigod! omigod!
it's el pollo loco! 
yeah, what's this about? we should be writing our monologues for smackdown.
(yeah, we've been talking.)
yeah?
what are you talking about?
dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against token.
well, so then wwe will recruit us and not them.
(they're gonna hurt our chances.)
(we've gotta bring somebody else on.)
how do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
it's simple. we just gotta hold tryouts.
you dirty muslim bastard! i don't trust you, and i never will! do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! no you wouldn't, you smelly brown middle eastern piece of sh-
your father! your own father!  i don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! whore!
yeah yeah, not bad.
damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
he's here, ohh my god  omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
alright, places everyone.
you aren't welcome here, triceratops!
stay calm, you know what you have to do.

no, you can't possibly mean that-!
he's alive!
heh whoa-ho! heh hey! whoawhoawhoa. whoahoho. eheheh. the fuck is this?
(i can keep the baby...)
dude.
aaaaah.
screw this, this is just stupid. 
fake!
(in japanese accent) fuck you weiru , anda fuck you dohfiiin! 
guys... guys...  look, i really think it's time for us to do something. this is all getting way out of hand.
"it seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!"
you're not?
kenny? you don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
you know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
but they say you know them. 
oh no, no, no.
oh what? so now that i have a hit tv show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
i asked you guys to help me and you said no!
"you said ""stan, me and kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"""
(i just want to be on tv.)
take us out of port! all hands to stations!
you're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
it's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.
(and they're all shot.) 
they do know. they know everything i've been trying to do for them.
i, i can't, i can't believe it.
dude, you know what? japanese people really do not like whales.  uh oh.
will you stop that?
things are bad enough without you being a smartass! there's whales out there being slaughtered right now and i can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
you have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
this is hiroshima. over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. we built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. 
at-a 8:15 a.m. the people of hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all.  women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated.  those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. burns, radiation poisoning. for generations the radiation affected the victims. japanese babies born without rimbs. without eyes! 
the americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. we were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with america. we will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! fuck you. fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe hiroshima. it was the-
great job, son. now the japanese are normal, like us.
aww! not those guys again! 
god! shut up!
all right let's head out. 
...what did you say?
yeah! 
broflovski looks for kenny to get clear for the pass.
yes.
okay good, yeah.
what are you guys talkin' about? harleys are neato!
alright, kyle and i are gonna spray paint messages to the harley riders; cartman, you said you had an idea?
oh that's good.
but that's a lot of seats? how are you going to pull that off?
"students, i am here because of a very serious matter. this morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, ""fags get out."" many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-"
w-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
so what if a guy is gay and rides a harley?
alright, how about this: what would you call a straight man who doesn't own a harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
...more and more harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
that, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. so we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
and tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, mr. emmanuel lewis. 
that's it, let's kill them all!
yeah! we did it, you guys! 
we will always remember the way that gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the pledge of allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. and even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, i know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. but now we must decide who will pick up up where little gordon left off. who will take his place reading the morning announcements? it's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? and although gordon stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
oh. my. goodddd.
oh, this is it, huh? okay, uhhh mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
m'kay eric, i'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
what? what on earth are you askin' me that for?!
beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 
oh jeez!
will somebody shut him up?
the job is to read what is written on the paper, eric, not to embellish the way you do.
no, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
well, because he was being murdered.
all we ask is you keep it shorter.
oh i will! and maybe i'll also have a word with the aclu, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! i'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
i pledge allegiance to the flag -
- a socialist dunghole...
oh god, no! 
nooo!
yeah, great job.
douglas.
hey eric!
oh you bet! i love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
cool, thanks.
what the hell do you think you're doing?!
i looked through your stupid book! it's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on wendy and calling her a slut!
"""wendy testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!"
"""or does she?"""
i'm not giving eric fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! i'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. if you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
eric, apparently you wrote that wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
eric, i've had enough! you cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! do i make myself clear?!
live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. here, is eric cartman.
whoa... 
"""these, are the morning announcements."" "
suck mah fat tits!
it's okay dad, i'll take care of it.
yeah, well, butters peed on my house.
if we could just keep it to questions about student council?
five seconds. 
sure.
okay.
i don't, i, i have no idea what-
ohhh, he's got her now!
i believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
she's speechless!
look, eric, you have to understand. the smurfberries were our school government's only option.
what was i supposed to do? the school was running out of power. we tried relocating the smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! so we decided to get somebody on the inside. a member of the school who could act like one of the smurfs and learn their secrets. but of course you know that, don't you?
i'm just asking a question. we all knew you were sent in to live with the smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
nobody expected you to fall in love with smurfette. you went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! do you know that one smurfberry can power the school for two months? one smurfberry!
i'm confused.
no, you're right. the students all deserve to know the truth. and so i have answered what really happened in my new book, going rogue on the smurfs.
luckily with the money i made selling the movie rights to my book, i'll be okay.
james cameron. go look. the movie came out already.
theh- they can't do that! i'm student body president!
oh god damn it! son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  you sons of bitches! dances with smurfs was my idea! my idea!  you can't just take dances with smurfs and call it something else! 
dude, what happened? you're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"the sun is up and the birds are chirping. i'm casey miller and these, are the morning announcements. i have a letter from second-grade student brian falner. brian writes, ""dear casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? my desk is broken, and so far eric cartman has done nothing about it. will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?"" well brian, i couldn't agree more. our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake."
i'm doin' the best i can! 
okay cartman, you can stop singing now. 
what do you guys wanna do first? i hear they have a new inner tube slide.
wha-what are you talking about, eric?
i'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
we got it, dad.
six adorable children please.
well cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right cartman?
no!
guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
just do it in english!
most likely.
dude, where have you been?
so what?
well then they're not minorities, are they?
dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
no, you're the minority!
this is more math than i've ever seen you do.
the who?
whoopie! 
do you need to wash your hands?
here! hey kid, grab this stick! 
are you okay?
we need to find somethin' to paddle with.
jesus christ!
all right, eric cartman, let's hear your book report.
hey! you're living in a minority-speaking country now! say it right!
good.
you don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
you're trash around here. you'll never make as much as a minority.
all those opposed?
the minorities win! 
wait here a minute, stan, i'm gonna call your mother. 
hawww, you lived?
that wasn't the mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
open the door, you motherfucker! 
what are you guys doing?
d'aaaah! fuck you, cunt!
it serves you right, you cheating turd! 
(yeah dude, i fucked you up.)
wow, i didn't know golf games were this cool.
aw dude, i clocked you!
hang on, hang on, i'm switching to a 7-iron. 
round 2. fight!! 
pre-nup power-up. 
a porn star?! you screwed a porn star?! 
i am so happy that i am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. now i can be faithful. and my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  so i officially announce my return to golf.
yeah, where's all the fighting?
okay kids, let's take our seats.  there has been a change in school policy, and so i'm assigning you all a book to read.
now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
tonight i want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
uh-yes, apparently john lennon's killer said he was inspired by the catcher in the rye, but he was just a kook! 
i know. i'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
why the hell was this book banned?!
(dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
the tale of... 
oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. alright, chapter... one...
no! i kn... i know! people need to read this book, sharon, this is... this is pulitzer prize stuff.
guys, guys! we are totally fucked! the book is gone from my dresser drawer. my parents must have found it!
well if i'm going down, cartman's going down!
well dude, somebody has got to go down!
i am?
oh no. which book was that?
okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... butters. 
that's nice. 
yeah, i'm broooding.
no, let me tell you somethin', fellers! you always take advantage of me, and after reading the catcher in the rye, i've learned you're nothing but phonies! i'm not letting you trick me this time! so the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
that's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
but what would be the point?
(it's fucking disgusting!)
what?! 
dude, we're not killing sarah jessica parker! 
shut up, cartman! just face it. we lost this one. 
(okay.)
"the poop that took a pee chapter 1: douglas had to poop. his butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. there was a gross woman named rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. douglas walked up to her and said, ""i need to poop."" ""okay,"" rebecca replied, ""i like poop."" douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. the poop sat there on rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.  chapter 2..."
(not yet) 
butters wrote a second book!
we can get people to believe us now!
aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
i agree. it wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
what are you talking about? this book is as pro-life as it gets!
leopold stotch... i hope they bury you! ...you evil fuck! 
thang, thanks, fellas. i'll definitely never write again. i think i can get over this.
what?
what?! oh no!
twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
you seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
alright kids, practice is over for today.
kfc!! 
cartman, you only come to soccer practice on fridays, and that's only because we have kentucky fried chicken afterwards!
a what?
kfc's gone, been replaced.
...so no kfc?
well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the ziggy marley concert next saturday in denver?
the kfc in salida is a long way away, sweetie. be patient.
eric, we're almost to frisco. why don't we go to the church's fried chicken there?
alright honey, let's take it easy.
fuck you!
it's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
yeah, well, that's because of the vote last november to ban fast food in low-income areas.
no you don't get it, kid. kfcs were only in low-income areas. in the entire state of colorado, kentucky fried chicken is illegal.
can i help you?
alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. 
this is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
if you don't want it, that's fine-
hey kid, they say you're looking for some kfc.
yeah well uh, we got some. over at billy miller's house.
ahhh eric cartman, right?
suuure.  jessie. 
i have my sources. that'll be $85.
hold on, hold on.  you're a big boy, eric. maybe you can pay me back another way. do a little job for me. i've got some serious kfc coming in from a dealer. i need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
i've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. you get the chicken for me, and i'll make sure you're hooked up for life. do you wanna do it?
alright, see you tomorrow!  oh god, i gotta hurry! caprica starts in five minutes!  huh-oh jesus!  ugh, ohh.  uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...rrrr. ugh, i gotta get home.  hey, hey, hey, this can work. this could... hey, it's like a hoppity hop. aaahah. whoa-ho. 
maybe i am. who's askin'?
oh, i got the hookup. question is, you got the money?  alright, we're in biz.  it's all there, man.
'course, man, i ain't no fool.
awww, it's all the same shit, man.
okay okay i'm sorry, oh... 
i'll take back the gravy.
what's going on back there?
cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
heyyy you're good eric. i need people like you!
"that's alright eric. i've got something big in the works. what if i told you... that i now have a direct line to get all the kfc we want here? i'm sending tommy to kentucky, to try and set up a little ""arrangement"" with the colonel himself."
that's right. and i'd like you to go as well and watch tommy's back for me. is that something you'd want to do?
we know, colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. we just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
your partner is an informant for jamie oliver. 
and how do i know you're not a liar too?
i think... you and me can work this thing out, eric. do business together a long time.
what, are you crazy eric?! making a deal with the colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! i can't move that much chicken!
...fine? i'm not making any money here! i'm losing it! i have to pay for more security, i got the cops up my ass, and i have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
how can i expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! you've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, eric!
what is that supposed to mean?
you wouldn't do that.
billy?! your father and i want to talk to you!
mr. cartman, come on. we're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
eric, the colonel is on the phone for you. he sounds pissed.
hello. hello??
what happened?
eric, what happened??
i heard.
because jamie oliver gave his speech at the un today. he was not supposed to give that speech, eric!
there's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
i told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
luckyyyyy!
how the hell do you have more friends than me?
aww, are you guys doing that stupid facebook stuff again?
dude, who the hell wants to play yahtzee?
yeah dude, we made you your own facebook page. 
i'm not collecting friends and i'm not building any farms! i don't wanna get sucked into this!
who?
dude, fuck facebook! seriously!  what the hell is this?! podcast?
i don't know what to do. i just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. i'm desperate. that's why i came to you.
i can't do that, i'd just feel too bad.
i've been trying! but i just don't know how to make totally new friends on the internet.
no. what's chatroulette?
hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
aww, that's some dude jacking off! 
that's just a guy's penis too!
dude, i don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
hey.
oh yeah? 
dude, screw this! i don't wanna see anymore!
yahtzee. 
that's it cartman, i'm outta here!  chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
hello.
our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
you should know, fatass.
kinda like cartman's dad shipped out on him.
what did you call me?
well it can be a reality. once we have muhammad, we can take that power from him. 
hey! it's one of the boys from south park who slandered me!
any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. 
yes, who needs more money, we need to get muhammad's goo! yes, yes, ariva ariva!
uh, excuse us for a second... 
what am i doing? just having some fun, cholo!
just keep your mouth shut, and do what i tell you!
if you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
think about it. muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. those celebrities want his goo.
you know what the goo is worth on the open market? hell, i got people in hong kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
more tacos!
more tacos.
i want more tacos! 
i am jennifer lopez, i need tacos to live!
oh, thank you 'harlie sheeeeen. and maybe an enchirito too?
yes they do!
not all taco bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
where the hell do you think you're going?
you gonna walk away from 50 mil? 
you walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
then i guess i won't tell you about your father. 
thought that might get your attention. you know nothing about your dad, right?
you really still believe that garbage? the people in your town sold you that line. come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. 
heh. i know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. you got lied to kid. by the people who were closest to you. i can prove it too, but i'm going to want something in return.
eric, what are you doing here?
what? n-no eric, are you still worried about that old issue, i mean-
eric, i haven't used mr. hat in a long time, and-
i said get. mr. hat!
eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
alright eric, your father was in the room the day of your dna test, but the results were... tampered with.
sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. that doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
no wait, i'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. please, come in. 
aaah!
eric cartman?
eric, your father never wanted this to happen. he was protecting you as well as them.
eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
oh, all right.
dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
stop talking with your stupid hand!
oh crap, the gingers!
heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.
you really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
you might wanna 
eric cartman. i've waited a long time for this.
guess again.  welcome, to my chili con carnival.
oh, but it can.  revenge is a dish best served...  chili.
do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? i spent quite a while in a mental institution, eric.  a lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day i could take you down. i even learned the name of your father.  oh, i know you're confused. who wouldn't be?  you've been lied to by everyone!  even by your own mother!  hahahahahahahaha. 
please, leave my boy alone!
please don't. we have to protect 'em.
they were having a really good year! there couldn't be any distractions!
would you like to meet him? well, you can't. ever. 'cause you see, eric, we have something in common. did i ever tell you that my father... played for the denver broncos?
you killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
wwait, what?
hey eric, eric!
come on, cheer up.
yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half denver bronco. that makes you pretty cool.
shut up kyle, you dumb jew.  you've got bronco blood in you, kid. that makes you awesome. me? i should be movin' on.
there's a bounty on my head and i can't afford to stay in one place for too long. so long... denver bronco.
alright. eric, do you wanna go next?
we're here for towelie, fatass!
this is serious, you fucking asshole!
kyle please, it is not your turn!
shut up, mimsssyyy!
cartman, dude, what's wrong?
dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. clearly, something's going on.
"""what i wanna be when i grow up""?"
why not?
cartman, tell us.
well cartman, if you wanna drive nascar when you grow up, you can.
aww. well cartman, you can change things about yourself.
dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
what?!
dude, i don't think just poor and stupid people like nascar!
(what?)
(yeah dude, i looove nascar.)
cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
dude, you are so retarded!
how are you rich?! your mom pays for everything!
i believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
then maybe i can make myself believe it too.  thanks you guys. i'm gonna go chase a dream. 
hey eric.
ahhh well oh- kay.
eeyeah, i'm psyched.
i'm really psyched! yeah! yeah let's do this alright?! i'm pumped i'm psyched! alright. yeah.
nasca- nascar?
you're givin' away all your money??
you sure you want to do this?
hey eric.
yep. you don't have a penny left.  you're poor as shit.  how come you're hangin' upside down?
feel stupid yet?
when a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to vagisil-
to stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
for the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
"whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! did you hear that?!  ""in some cases vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  oh my god, butters...  we need vagisil!"
gee-whiz, there's vagi-everythings.
wuh- uh i'm buyin'?
but but i uh, i uh, i didn't bring any money, i didn't know i had to buy vagisil.
no, you're good. 
little boy, what are you doing? 
really?
that was fast.
oh my god! 
eric, are you sure you can do this?
let the race begin!
i think you gotta press the gas pedal.
there's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
it looks like the dale evans car is going the wrong way!
kewl, nascar! sweet! 
eric?
eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
eric! don't ever talk like that!
well at least there's that.
you aren't on life-support. pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
you're lucky to be alive, young man. sneaking onto a nascar racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? that has got to be the stupidest thing i've ever heard of a kid doing! 
did you hear that, eric? see? you are really stupid.
it has to be, eric.  eric, where are you going?
(oh that fucking asshole!)  (oh that fucking asshole, i'm gonna talk to him...)
(dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
(dude, fuck you!)
(being poor has nothing to do with nascar!)
(no you fucking don't!)
(what?!)
uh, excuse me.  eric cartman?
my name is geoff hamill. i'm the founder and ceo of vagisil.
young man, your nascar stunt has brought a lot of attention to vagisil and honestly, i don't know how to thank you. our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. i first created vagisil for my wife, patty. she's my muse, my flame. we realized that nascar can do a lot for product recognition and so, vagisil has a little present... for you. 
vagisil would like you to represent us in the next nascar race.
and we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
well i think it's a fine track, you know. the- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
hey excuse me, who is this kid? is he even a driver?
can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
you seemed really stupid, eric.
alright, from the nfl we now turn to the world of nascar! people who weren't sure what to think of nascar are more sure today after a nascar driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
obama's fuckin' gay.
pissin' me off!
gentlemen, start your engines! 
the drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
this is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
the fuck are you doing?!
oh, son of a bitch!
be careful up here about a hundred yards, eric. there's a wrecked car on the right side.  you're gonna wanna watch for it here. you're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
aaaaaa! 
that's fuckin' gay as hell.
there you go. you're back on the track.
(stop this car!)
oh man, now our friend kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. ain't that just gay as hell? 
(i fucking hate you!)
let me talk to her.  patty? patty, what are you doing?  patty, pull over the nascar. you're acting irrationally. patty, did you forget to take your medication? you know how you get when you don't use your vagisil. there should be some in your purse, my muse. patty? 
i know. that pisses me off. that's fuckin' gay.
they are neck and neck approaching the finish line. 
(ha! you fucking lose!)
huh?
uh, but- but you- you said i had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what i can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
you guys do not understand. having neighbors from jersey is the worst! all night long they keep me awake! they're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. it seems like all people from jersey do is hump and punch each other!
is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
hey, you talkin' 'bout jersey? me and my friends are from jersey.
you wouldn't understand. it's a jersey thing. 
hey, dudes.
what are you talking about?
so what?
no, it doesn't!
i'm not from jersey. i was born here.
what's strike three?!
no, uh, it just explains a lot.
no, it isn't!
(yeah.)
oh, really? well, okay, mr. i'm-awesome-at-geography!
tryin' to help. my dad says to distribute all these guns.
i told you cartman, i'm not one of them! i don't wanna live in west jersey any more than you do!
that's enough!
aaaarrghhhhhh!  i'm not one of them! do you understand me?! you'd better get that through your fat head! i will never be one of them, and if you say it again, i swear to god, i'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
shoot it! 
kyle did that? gee whiz.
are you being serious?
yeah, but lockin' kyle in a meat freezer? i mean, he could die.
neaaaaaah! snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
cartman, what the hell are we doing at sizzler?
(what kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 
why?
you just wanna lock me in there because you think i'm one of them.
i'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
dude, what are you doing?
all right, fine, cartman! you really want me to go in there, i'll...  dude, cartman, what is that behind you?
no, i'm serious. what is that behind you?
snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
try to find a way past it!
smoosh smoosh. snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
you're garbage! you know that?! you're cabbage!  you've got cabbage in your muff!  you've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
yeah. the more distance between me and the others from jersey, the better i feel.
we got him!
we need to talk.
can i help you?
yes?
the captain is very busy dealing with the gulf oil crisis.
please, sit down. what can i do for you?
of what?
tell brett favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  it's not a blessing, it's a curse.
look, i'm sorry kid, but i work alone.
get this kid out of here! i have to think!
it's up to us, guys. let's get to the gulf! 
darkness has taken over our town. the coon and friends have given in to evil. it's up to the coon to stop them.
you guys have no idea how much it sucks! my dad's obsessed! every day it's bobby flay this, gordon ramsey that. this morning he was pretending to read playboy, but he actually had a bon appetit magazine hidden inside it!
i quit. now, what i have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
he won't listen to us, but he would listen to- gordon ramsay.
let's hear it, cartman!
ahhh.
yes chef!
line
tom saltzman says you don't really have an ipad.
tom saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an ipad cover and you're faking it. 
let me see your ipad, cartman.
just let us see your ipad, cartman.
so, plug it in.
i left my charger at home!  fine! i'm gonna go home and charge my ipad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
what happened, eric?
you said we could.
oh, sweetie, $900?
eric, we can't afford that one.
i think we need to get you a different brand, hon. they're a little cheaper.
here, look at this one. a toshiba handibook.
this says it does everything the ipad does, at half the price.
eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! you can either have the toshiba handibook or you can have nothing at all!
eric!
stop crying, eric! i told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
you made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
"then why did you go outside to a police officer and say ""help! help! my mommy is trying to fuck me!""?"
if you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!
no!
i want you all to meet eric cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
does this happen often? does she- does she fuck you a lot?
now, i know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
your mother fucked you at best buy?
and people saw her doing this?
and they didn't do anything?
eric, stop it!
booooooo!
i don't!
awwwwww!
well eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
when dr. phil contacted us at apple with eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard.  and so, eric, here is your very own humancentipad. 
do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing applecare?
sorry, we have to recall this.
come on. we'll get you separated, little boy.  guess you won't be eating japanese food for a while, huh? 
here you go.  here you  go. don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  here you go, fellas. be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
president wulff went on to assure the world that germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.
duh-n, don't worry fellas. everything's gonna be okay.
is it true? do germans wanna kill us?
what- what am i supposed to s-say?
was machst du? rück mit die andern. 
wie ein fehler? 
wollen sie endlich beutren sein? 
zurück! mit ander, oder sterben! 
what's that? could you say that in the other ear?
nono, you guys gotta see funnybot in hangover 3. i'm telling you, it's his best work.
ya everything's worse. it's the worstest of the worst, that's what i'm sayin'. oh lerrrd. 
you little shit! what the fuck have you done to us?!
tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed hispanics to sandra bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. the blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.
dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
i have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. goodbye, everybody. i'm going to spend my final moments on this earth with my loved ones... watching a tyler perry movie. i know, it's embarrassing. but i simply can't help myself.
we've got to get it away from that control panel. does anybody have any ideas?
ahhh i've seen this before. whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
don't worry, fellas. i learned my lesson. i promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
my sister is a den leader in girl scouts.
skeletor's a lady??
hey eric.
you get in trouble again, cartman?
dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
yeah.
no they didn't.
dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
that doesn't make any sense.
go look for yourselves!!
is that really all our wiener sizes?
wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. that doesn't seem right.
a conspiracy?
well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
oh, there's something we can do about it alright! if they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! we are going to remeasure!!
alright.
whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. where're you going, little feller?
hang on, he's coming back out. there he is. who's a little guy?
i'm hung like a horse!
didn't you forget something?
you measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
thirteen point seven inches?
you made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
you just did that to everybody in class!
gross!
eric cartman to the principal's office immediately.
oh, goddamnit!
you're darn right, eric!
why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
what?
wait. are you talking about the numbers we published tuesday from the physical?
the numbers we put up were height differentials. 
we thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. you grew 1.2 inches.
why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
we didn't!
this is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, eric. you get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. this time you've done it to yourself!
because you have an anger problem, eric!
let's try a little experiment. i wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, eric. okay? how do you think you would react if i said some negative things about you?
excuse me.  carol, what? ...whoa, calm down honey. what do you mean? web chat with wha-? what 14-year-old girl? carol, i would ne-  no i don't have a criminal record. who would- who is mitch conner?! there can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- no no, carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the  carol? carol! 
man, this shit wack, manh. i just see all this shit fummah. i'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.
well, eric, because i know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
no no, i'm not saying that, at all. please i, i'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
no, my, my shit be packing, manh.
yeeaahh!
yeeaahh!
burn it down! 
we're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! and i think that- uhh,  is that it?
no, please!
"the winds of change are blowin'.
there's excitement in the air.
can you feel it? it's electric and magical.
the happy train's on track.
'cause america is back!
woohoo! come on!"
"america is back!
america is back!"
"we're back, we're back, we're back back back!
america is back!"
come, come, right over here.  we have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. it's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 
what are you doing here?
...what are you doing here?!
why do you have a video camera?
wuuuuhhhhhh! 
ah, crap! 
so what are you doing?!
alright, what is it?!
why do you need me?
i knew you were doing something terrible!
lots of people will when i tell them!
you what?
a thousand dollars.
dude, this thing is huge. and it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. we're swimming in cash, kyle. let me take you out to denny's. it's baconalia time.
ah, mr. cartman. we have your table waiting, sir.
come on. 
it's awesome.
every single night.
wow...
"i like that boom boom pow
them chicks be jackin my style
they try and copy my swagger
i'm on that next shit now
i'm so 2008you so 2000 and late
i got that boom boom boom
that future boom boom boom
let me get it now"
you've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, kyle. and best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
and it actually helps the crack babies. it's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
no no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. here, check it out.  see look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. it's really getting popular!  i mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  it, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? you see that? two million hits.  did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at denny's?
whatta you want?
oh gohhhd.
it's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until i use again.
i don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! but i can't stop! 
the what?
they said it's a boy.
how much will he make?
so what? you would make money off of my child? that doesn't seem fair.
cain't you change the rules?
i do not sound like cartman goddamnit!  okay, so, see ya. 
we're just having a hard time finding him.
i need to talk to you. 
in our deal with ea sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. but we aren't paying the crack babies.
but this video game can make a million dollars. we have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
gut they're the ones risking injury.
the government could come after us, cartman.
so then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an internet ad to payless shoe source go?
a hot tub?!
gravy?
no way.
i know, but dude, we can't license our games to ea sports and pay the crack babies nothing. slavery is illegal.
a what? send him in. 
in the what?
i have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
are you referring to our student athletes?
look, there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.
we do  not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.
get out! this is a prestigious university and i am not saying one more word to you!
it happens to be called poutine in montreal! 
we must have just missed him. he was playing at cherry creek mall and then flat irons mall. now we don't know where to go because slash is playing the pavilion in colorado springs in the gigadome in moscow later this afternoon.
we don't know. he's everywhere.
oh, that's a good idea.
alright cartman, i've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the ea sports deal. we're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
i've designed it to be the best place for them to live. a place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. and if you think it's a bad idea, i really don't care!
...what?
you guys! you guuys! we've got some bad news. slash isn't real. 
here, look for yourself.  he's based on the fable of a dutch saint named vunter slash. 
what?
one of our parents.
one of our parents!
you guys are ten years old and you just figured out that slash isn't real? oh my god. 
oh, well, fuck 'em. and fuck you too. i piss in your faces. 
you guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
vunter slash kapunshka. shpielerin manshunshka. het mine gaset rosa. danka vunter slasha
yay! 
yeah! open mine first stan! it's the red one! 
here you go, sweetie.
yes. every time somebody gets a birthday present eric gets one too.  otherwise, he gets a little upset.
i know how you like legos. happy birthday!
oh thanks, dude.
here you are, muffin. 
i've told you what i think of this music, stanley. you have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
gross!
oh dude! dude, this is the part i was talking about. check out the bassline on this! 
nnooh. that's stevie ray vaughn. steamy ray vaughn just shits his britches.
alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
agh, that shitty game? who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the x button?
it just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
i thought you guys were sick! 
jesus, how long before they start this goddamned thing?! 
this november, adam sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth.  it's adam sandler in pbbbbbt, rated arg for pirates. fuck you!
ugh.
oh dude dude wait, i'm sorry.
hang on guys!
oh shut up cartman! you don't even know what you're talking about!
(are you serious?!)
that's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or asperger's!
that's what they're talking about on the news!
yes!
you wanna bet?  let's go ask my dad right now!
mr. garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
you mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
it is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
eric, what is it this time?
you don't feel warm.
can you lay on your stomach?
what the?  what is this? a hamburger? 
why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
this doesn't make sense. are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
very funny!
no. i can't, wendy.  all his negativity is starting to make me depressed. i have to let him go.  and whatever happens next, i'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
what's the matter dude?
you made hamburgers? well that's awesome! i'd love one.  mmm. hm, wow  this is really good, cartman.
seriously, cartman. you could make money with these!
we found a way to make it stop, stan. now are you interested? or not?
i just can't believe how yummy these are.
thanks!
about three minutes, fatass!
jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, eric. we need more.
dude, come on cartman. as employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
see? there you go again. look at you dude. look what you've become.
yeah, it's fine.
there, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
dude, we're gonna see the new zoopeeker movie!
...k, coming. 
eric, you wanna say hi to grandpa?
look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. we'll use the texans' emotions against them.
hey texans! let me through; we want a treaty!
better than being a fatass texan!
no, you're fat to begin with, chubby! now you're texan too!
base! 
i was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
base!
i didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
eh, b-base.
cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
so then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
oh darling, it's wonderful.
what are you talking about?
jesus, it's freezing out here. he, he could be dead.
cartman, what the hell is this?! 
"""wanted by u.s. border patrol""?! ""permission to shoot on sight""?!"
butters has been missing for a week! you might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
do you have what it takes to join the border patrol? border patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
the standard-issue border patrol weapon is the p-29 stun baton. it carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.
you're pretty good at stoppin' mexicans, son. what's your name?
...what did he say? ah i actually don't speak spanish.
come on now, come on! you've got it. 
game on!
what the fuck are you doin'?!
aaaah!  i'll get over! 
ohhh!
mantequilla ayudar ¡1a border patrol! 
border patrol pegaron ¡el zero gordo! 
haha! heheeheeheehahaheehee!
stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, cartman!
¡ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...  ¡oy! ¡oy!  ¡orgullo!  ¡maaantequilla! 
a baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
what?
the blond kid?
what about him?
how do you know?!
what's that?
hey, did you guys see eavesdropper? pete melman shit his pants! 
hey, did you guys see eavesdropper?
hey! pete melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
attention south park students: will the following students report to the principal's office immediately? eric cartman? thank you.
eric, as you might have heard, a student here in south park elementary had an accident in the classroom.
oookay, but you probably understand that for pete, it isn't that funny. for him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
eric, it has been almost one year since corey duran defecated in his pants here in school. now, you remember what happened to him?
yes, and the reason he killed himself, eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students,  spearheaded by you, cause him-!
spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
please just let it go.
we are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
alright eric, here's the deal: this school cannot have another suicide on its hands. we want you to see pete melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
if pete melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
it's megasuperhilarious! 
what do you want?!
yeah, it's gross! 
so what?
i don't like you!
they're not fish like some of you retards chose.
yeah, i'm fine, i just- awwgh!  m-mr. garrison? can i please  be excused?
well okay.
please! i've gotta go now!
eeeeww! 
sick!
...the doctors say that jenny simon barely survived the fall. jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
no, not cool! m'kay, she's on suicide watch, eric! she's given up on life!
that's wasn't the point, eric! nobody was supposed to kill themselves! unless you fix this our deal is off!
yes!
our students did average, maybe just below average.
that's insane!
no wikileaks! bad!
eh, is this one good?
you sure this will work, eric? what if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
alright eric, well, well get back to class. we don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
alright, fine. bring her in, adler. 
hi eric. i understand you really wanted to meet me. wanna get a picture together?
okay, eric, you got what you wanted. are we straight?
yeah, but you know? i think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
oh eric! uh, eric, i know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but i hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
well i think you're being very mature about this, eric. it was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. i wanna thank you. mkay.
well students, why don't we uh-  oooh. oh, gee, uh...
yeah, i j-i just uh i'll be right back. oh!  aaaah! oh it's bad!  excuse me kids, i need to run, i gotta wuugh!  ow!
do something, you stupid vegan!
four weeks we gotta do this?
alright mccormick, let's start with you. climb the rope. 
alright, let's go broflovski. 
alright cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
yeah. we're paying for your being fat.
we are here because of you, eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
oh grow up.
yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 
but eric, you are cool.
it's not your fault, eric. how can they blame you for what is clearly president obama's fault?
yeah, that's right eric. you don't need to grow up. you are awesome and keeewl.
uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
all you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. i warn you: this could turn very ugly.
no, sweetie, i've been at the hair salon. why?
are you sure, sweetie?
but who would want to s-
what?
no.  nooo!  clyde frog!!  they took clyde frog! 
clyde frog! clyde!? clyde frog?!  clyde. clyde frog! 
shut the hell up, cartman!
how do you murder a stuffed animal?!
how do you murder a stuffed animal?! you tell us, kyle!  butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. there's still a biiig investigation to come. and until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as kyle. thank you so much. bagpipes please. 
where's our five dollars?
yeah.
hurry up, screw this.
tom, i'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy red robin. occupy red robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically i am part of the 99% so, what do i have to say about all this? 
why would somebody hurt clyde frog, eric? especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
let's stop the charades, eric, and let's get down to business.
sit down, you fucking bitch.
"then why did you write in your diary ""it was probably time for eric to grow out of his stuffed animals"" anyway?!"
eric, i promise you, i didn't do anything to your favorite toy. whoever did this to you, i hate them as much as you do, and i'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
damnit! don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  full-on class warfare.
the fire started with this. definitely a case of arson. somebody hates this kid.
eh, eric.
sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
i asked little eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend token.
why are you involving me in this?
will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
this is my room! i'll take the remote from you!
you're a guest here! your mom isn't in charge!
that's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
i don't know.
i thought i was safe here! stay there guys, i'll be right back! 
a motion detector. 
it's not me! i'm here to help you, fatass!
stop it, cartman! it's true! we came to keep an eye out. stephen tamil said he had something big planned.
(i don't really know!)
hey! cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
yeeah!
hello??  whoever you are, just give them back! haven't you done enough to me?! 
muscleman marc! aaaaaaaa!! aaaaaaaa!! 
eric! don't come any closer!
you said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
no eric, don't come any- 
it's okay, eric. it's over now. 
don't you see? the kids at school were right, eric. it was time for us to grow up.
yes, they're gone. and now we can grow up and be together.
dead-bolted. token!  token, you in there?! 
no, i thought of everything! it all happened here so that everyone would think token did it. all the blame will be on him. and we can live happily ever after.
oh no! you're totally right! but i thought my plan was perfect! i failed! i failed you! you have to kill me eric! so that you don't get blamed!
it's the only way eric. you have to do it. please! i can't live with myself after what i've done. please, you have to do it eric.
hello boys and girls. my name is david running horse... sawitsky, and i am one sixteenth cherokee indian.
thanksgiving is about murder?
well, it is kinda true, you know? thanksgiving is fun and all, but the native americans got pretty screwed over.
hey, fatass! instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
we all have to do this report together, dude.
how is that gonna help?!
a lot has been written about the first thanksgiving between pilgrims and native americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
and what about the food?  does the appearance of stuffing at the first thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? 
what??
we're not basing research for our report on this crap!
dude!
they found something. this could be it. 
...what?
dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
now it is our time! we shall attack plymouth, and we will take... all their stuffing! 
what hon?
uhoh, thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. i haven't gone shoppies yet.
what is it, hon?
clyde donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! get your coat on, mom! we've gotta go to the store! 
stuffing? sure. aisle 17.
oh no!
no!
wow, there's a lot about thanksgiving i never knew before.
the pilgrims welcomed the indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? 
alright, good. now get in the car! 
we can't let kenny be sent away forever. there's gotta be something we can do.
really?
that's what you care about?! who's the poorest kid in school now?!
what are you talking about?
good!
yep. to find out who the poorest kid in school is, i actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
so then i crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
well actually, eric, it's you. 
now that kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  i'm sorry, pal.
uh, i won't tell anybody.
oh come on! we're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! you think, you think kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless jew!  well i won't give him the satisfaction!
"my name. is not. ""kyel."""
hi, sweetie.
oh, what is it this time? 
what, hon?
eric, i'm working two jobs. mommy's doing everything she can.
well, we're in a tough economy, eric. i don't know what else you want me to do about it.
eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
oh. 
it's not funny, mom!! 
then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
hi there, how you doin'? my name's mr. adams, and i'm with child protective services.  here's my head shot.  i just need to get some information from you if that's okay.
okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
and it also says here that penn state prefers to be losing at halftime? because at penn state they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. that's a joke. did you get that one? it's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
we just - no, we just like to have fun here.
what? what, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? you think you're funny?
could be worse.
could be in happy valley! on a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from penn state?
two penn state administrators walk into a butt-!
hawaii?
your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of hawaii.
come on now! this is not the way we told you to tidy up! remember? cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! amanda! more ambiguous on the dusting!  kenneth, answer the door! 
hello eric, your room is upstairs to the left. are you hungry?
you can call me mom if you like.
this is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. you will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you will follow the agnostic code: we cannot know for certain if god or christ existed. they could. then again there could be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. can we be certain there isn't? no, so it's pointless to talk about. now say it with me.
hey! we do not take the lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
my name. is not. meom!
(i'll be there, karen.) 
does he live with you at the foster home?
what are you talking about? the poor kid at this school is jacob hallery. 
yeah, dude. his dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
(uh huh.)
eric, at greeley elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
"a twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven ""yo momma so poor"" jokes directed at jacob hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks."
your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
"i know this is a difficult adjustment for you, eric! but you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! i mean, what do you think this is?! the shower room at penn state?! i'm kidding. we like to have fun in our department, so i was like, ""oh, look. what? is this like the shower room at penn state?!"" i joke around. this is my head shot. "
mr. and mrs. weatherhead, i received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
a false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
we can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
then we'll add another charge for resisting!
(good for me.)
how was jail, fatass?!
...what the fuck?!
no, not okay. because you aren't getting the message! what if i'd fallen in? start listening to me! put it down! put it down!  thank you. 
look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
of course, man. it's cool.
cartman, it was actually really lame.
you're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. let's go.
i know, fatass. i was there.
that's not what she said. you're putting extras on again. it's not that funny.
don't you just feel a little bad for clyde?
from what?
hello terrance. hello phillip.
oh sure. 
it's the toilet safety administration, hun. they're gonna do something to the potty.
my potty? what are they going to do to it? 
federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
this is for your safety. a woman died, you know.
no, i was talking to my asshole. c-c'mon, asshole. let's get back to work. 
i'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. 
all right, do you mind if i touch your balls, sir?
it's okay, sir. there's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
yeah.
yeah, you will.
what about us loggers? hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
we've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
it is time for us all to grow up.
yeah.
you can't sue the dead, clyde. putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. it's common sense, clyde!
that's what that hole is for? oh.  oops.
that's not what i said.
hah. yeah, well, i'm just glad that stupid tsa crap is over with. i know you've had a tough week, clyde. but at least your mom didn't die for nothing. i mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of american freedom. so technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... clyde? clyde?

copy that. 10 seconds, cartman.
go, go, go.
i have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  faith hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. from football quarterback to football singer.
these youths paid with their lives for tebowing. when they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs , bunny ears  and fake wiener  maybe you think this doesn't apply to you, maybe you think your memes are safe. or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. well, if you are watching his in the future,  get off your flying cellphone scooters and think. just remember.  use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. peace signs, bunny ears, and fake wieners. 
so, what do you want to do now?
what?! you mean you guys still plan on faith hilling after what we just saw?
hey, did you see today's newspaper?
you guys made the front page.
dude, we are on the front page!
can we get a different pose, please? 
it says... oh, oh no. it says faith hilling is now all like 2000-late.
"""faith hilling is pretty stale,"" said republican candidate newt gingrich. ""if they had crashed the debate by taylor swifting that would have been impressive."""
that's all it is? 
but that's stupid.  how can that replace faith hilling? it doesn't even make any sense.
okay. hold it there. okay. that's good, don't move. 
yep, that's great. 
hey, what are you doing?
come on guys. it's not worth it. we can do our taylor swifting somewhere else.   knock it off!
if they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures,  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. 
yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
no, no, no! these stupid fads are only that, okay? we can't give in to this crap.
oh long johnson, oh long- 
yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say oh long johnson. i thought just, you know, try it out.
you guys are sellouts.
you're freaking sellouts!
how droll. 
we have to face it, cartman.
i really thought it was gonna last.
it wasn't like faith hilling was that great. i mean-
i-it's good that it became something else.
okay, that's good, a little higher.
meow.
meow.
alright, go cartman.
it's super awesome.
meow, meow.
two, one. go cartman!
come on, dude. hurry.
yeah. do it, cartman.
wow!
have you ever seen faith hilling so good?
oh long johnson.
yes, yes, this whole coming week is the jewish holiday of passover. yes, it's all about how moses led the hebrews out of egypt. very good! so on friday, all jewish people will celebrate passover with a seder dinner.  because god commanded the jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on friday to the next friday.
well, because in ancient egypt, god passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
get out of here.
get. outta here! 
what are you gonna do?
no?
what does that have to do with passover?
(me, too.)
jewpa what?
okay.  so anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
you mean it's like, like a monster?
nuh-uh!
you guys, check this out! 
aaaaaahhh! 
alright, alright! knock it off! stop spreading lies.
i looked on the known species webpage. there's no animal called a 'jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
lu lu lu, lu... n-no such thing as j-jewpacabra. people made it up.  it's -- that's okay. even if there was a j-jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
aaaaahhh!
no, it's a school night!
butters, do you know how many times jewpacabra has been shot on video? zee-ro!  i can't do this alone, please. help me prove to the rest of the world jewpacabra is real.
you think jewpacabra is here?
oh good. maybe we scared it off?
oh god, i'm scared.
eric, stop it!
i'm not saying jesus is a lie!
jesus is a lie?
nope. i don't think... christ has any basis in reality.
we started sooper foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. we are not canceling our easter egg hunt because of some wild story!
that wasn't a dog?
what?
so where are we heading first?
the bahamas?
that's right. there's a resort near there called 'the atlantis hotel and casino'. they have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
where to now?
would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
these people aren't going to prove anything. to believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
that's what i'm thinking.
jewpacabra?
but it makes total sense. if we rule out a human and a baby sasquatch, jewpacabra is all we really have left.
but it's supposed to be all yellow-y. my god! this really is proof of a jewpacabra!
we've never seen this before! it really is true!
that's right, bobo. whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
i'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
if it is a jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. 
what are you doing?
okay, okay. even if there was a jewpacabra, it wouldn't know i was the one who got video of it, huh? how could it know that? it couldn't know that, right? kyle? 
"jesus loves me this i know
'cause republicans tell me so
little ones god will protect
'cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
everything still clear out there?"
it's all quiet out front, eric.
he says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
hey, eric.
well, we got scared so we're next door at wingstreet. 
yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
alright, grab him.
you say the jewpacabra hunts for anything easter, and now it's looking for you. 
look, we're sorry. but if it's you that jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
just a little blood to try and draw it out. we just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. our entire business is based on fun and safety.
maybe it won't even show up. maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  oh fuck, we better get out of here. 
hello young man. let me start off by saying sooper foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  but... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. thank you. 
admit you're lying, and i'll let you go.
oh, of course i was lying, kyle. there's no jewpacabra. now, please, kyle, it's easter eve! and if jewpacabra smells this blood, i am in a heap of trouble!  no kyle! no, wait! i'm sorry i couldn't help it! kyle?! please i'll give you money! i have lots of money!  oh god, what am i doing?  i mean, i mean, i don't have any money! i'm totally broke!  oh god, i am in a heap of trouble.
bobo shoot it! 
alright! come on, let's go!
ugh... what... where...
the plagues! the plagues are upon us! run!
yes. it's because the pharaoh won't give the hebrews what we want! god is angry.
that's how god is! and if pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all egyptian first born boys!
it doesn't matter. because god is going to harden the pharaoh's heart!
it means jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the pharaoh from letting us go.
that's just how god is.
you're wrong, kyle! god is not a dick! 
it'll be okay, my son. the weather will clear.
it's a complicated political issue, my son. an economic social issue that needs time. we can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the usa?
poor frogs. i feel so badly for them.
hah, i don't think god would do such a thing, little one. no matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the hebrew version of god. we believe in a just lord who would never murder innocent children.
and i love you son. and our love grows.
"and our love grows
like the mighty river of the nileriver of the nile
see it flow
we'll never be apart"
this is what god told us to do!
you'll see! 
what's happening to us? 
mom! don't let god kill me! 
care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
son! we were wrong! i was wrong!
we were wrong! i'm sorry god i'll be jewish i promise! please don't kill me! don't kill me! doooo...! 
there are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: fun and safety. on this beautiful easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of south park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  4 in fun and number 6 in safety. let the hunt begin. 
oh, stop trying to ruin easter, you! you heathen! 
yeah.
i know, you're not.
happy passover, cartman. 
naw, i don't want kids calling me a cliché conflict resolution kevin.
good for you, stan. it's nice somebody in this school has some balls.
yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
"bullying isn't cool. bullying is lame.
bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
for a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
and i think i know what we should do to i-it.
do do do do do to i-it.
let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
bullying's an ugly thing
lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
woah-oh. woah-oh. woah-oh."
"we can make it stop. we can stomp it out.
we can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
and beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
if if if it ever te-lls.
lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
it'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
woah-oh. woah-oh. woah-oh."
oh, you gonna kwy?! oh don't kwy, you'll look bad with your wittle captain kangaroo haircut! 
excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
wha? what's the movie studio saying about it?
aaaaaaah! i can't take it! 
we were stuck. we were completely stuck. 
"for four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of ""i should have never gone ziplining""."
we could go to the city pool. they have a water slide
(what?!)
(this is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
and then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
cool! ziplining.
within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from stan's uncle jimbo. 
we were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of kenny's herpes.
(dude, it's just a fever blister!)
all right, you guys look ready to zipline!
we don't mind.
thanks michael.  anybody have any questions?
jesus christ!
"it's a devastating blow. for kyle, it's almost too much to bear.  his brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word ""shuttle"" makes kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. "
dude, did you fart?!
alright, here we are. looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
"alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when i call out ""shockabra!"", look up and give the camera a nice ""shockabra"" . alright, you ready?"
ready to do some zippin'?
"alright, let's hear you say ""zipliiine!"""
well? how was it, cartman?
oh, really??
alright guys, let's get movin'! only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! 
stop!
"""ack"" went the little frog one day. ""ack"" went the little green frog..."
the fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
woohoo!
me?!
oh no, don't try to pin this on me! you're the one who brought it up!
you fat piece of shit!
dude! did you just shit your pants?!
long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
the stop drinking double dew, fatass!
you're in a forest! go take a crap!
step right out here, we'll get you going.  got four more for you, duncan. 
aaaah! 
aaaaaaaaaah!
you guys, you guys! get up! listen to me! there's a lake a hundred yards down that way! they've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
the fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
the boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
i don't know, i-i just thought if we all drank the mountain dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. i told cartman he has to share it.
oh my god, they killed kenny! you bastards!
stop it! it was me! my idea.
i had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
but then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. 
it was a miracle. he came to save us and take us back home.
howdy ho, boys? let's get you back home. 
after nearly four hours in the colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. from the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard mr. hankey's magical helicrapter.  in the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that mr. hankey then had to fly them on his seven turdy seven.  from there, it was only an hour ride back home on the poochoo express.  four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. kenny mccormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  and the boys received treatment for their herpes. 
kyle broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. stan marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  his awareness videos became so popular that stan once again ended up jacking it in san diego. as for eric cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. in just two weeks, he was back to drinking diet double dew, defiant to dew the math.
guess what larry barsky just told me?!
(yeah, what's her name?)
theh theh, there she is. 
why?! why are you happy for me?!
nothing! 
and so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the greeks and the romans. remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of westeroth. the king of westeroth was who? robert baratheon , and he asked eddard, also known as, of course, lord stark, to serve as hand of the king. you remember that lord stark accepted, or course. the queen's family - that's the lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? but where were the targaryens at this time? well, they were across the sea. we all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. so we've got the greeks, the romans, the starks, lannisters, baratheons, targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in season 2. now, what i really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
will you shut the hell up?! 
no!
token, is there a problem? 
everyone pay attention!  now, what i really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? the night's watch- 
so then kelly i guess told stacey that she wasn't invited, so now stacey's pissed at us.
why?!
about token? why?
token likes nichole?
oh yeah, i don't think she has any idea.
okay.
oooo, kyle.
haha, shut up you guys! it's just a crush. 
we are cows, proud and true! count on south park, moo moo moo! goooo cows! 
yeah. 
oh no, who told you that?
ohhh.
wow, ah i'm sorry. i totally respect that.  hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, thanks.  dude, that new girl's into me!
how come?
are you sure, eric? i mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
oh, he does?  okay.
yeahh, it kind of was. maybe... uh i don't know. maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
cool. well... thanks again. 
we did it, eric. we found in each other a ray of sunshine.
teeheeheehee. 
"i see the questions in your eyes.
i know what's weighing on your mind.
you can be sure i know, my heart.
girl i'll stand beside you through the years
you'll only cry those happy tears
and though i make mistakes, i'll never break your heart
i swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
i'll be there
i swear (i swear) like a shadow that's by your side (keep it down, girl)
i'll be there
for better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
i'll love you with every black beat of my heart
and i swear. i swear. i s-we-e-e-ear yeah, i swear. straight up. what it do?"
dude, why are you so into their relationship?
you motherfucker! 
what the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
the new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
actually, i heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
teehee, that was us, remember, eric?
what?!
who is cupid me?!
you are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
yeah, just try the white meat. i know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
teeheeheehee, heeheehee.
sorry. 
heeheeheeheeheehee.
they're fudgey charms of sunshine.
teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. 
heeheehee, no! 
everything okay, sweetie?
okay. 
it's gonna be okay, eric.
they'll find love somewhere else.
yes, they will.
teeheehee. looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
in...in who, eric?
i work hard, so i need a laxative that works hard too!  i can't be constipated on the job.  that's why i need... soft serve.  because when i'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough.  don't give up. get back in there and get to work!  'cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
no, you don't.
no, you don't. 
teehee, stop it.
heeheehee, heeheeheehee,  heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
i'm sorry, but she's at the denver nuggets game.
yeah, she went with a nice white, jewish boy.
"o! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
whose broad stripes and bright stars-"
awww! 
tickets please.
we're all set for the tipoff. 
awwwww. 
i swear, kyle.
he did that? oh no.
yay! 
teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place.
that's right, and i found somebody who's just the same as you!
there she is! 
teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! 
haaagh! 
that's true. old eric tells me i should work at a thai massage parlor, i'm so good at sucking.
this game is stupid. i have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as i can to the other team!
this great game isn't about plays. it's about sportsmanship. and compassion. and when i look around this locker room, well i see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys i've ever met!  well token, you're nicer than anybody i know.  and clyde! well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
yeah! yeah!
we don't have a coach, kyle.
oh jeez n-no, i i don't know, fellas.
that's it! 
wuh sure, eric. 
uh-uh oh, no e-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
oh, well, ye-eric, ah i told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
...oh right, i, i'm sorry. well, everyone has a creamy filling, eric. and and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. a lot of times, when i go to sleep, and especially if i've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes i wake up, and when i wake up, i i realize some of my goo has come out.  but i always make sure i keep it, just in case i ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
my goo doesn't come out every night, but i sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
i don't know. weh i never really thought of it that way. 
do you feel warm and compassionate?
stay positive, stan! all right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  now what is goin' on out there?
i don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
you find a good catcher's mitt, cartman?
well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
right, you're not fat.
excuse me.  excuse me! 
you've gotta be kidding me!
are those candy corn oreos?
yeah... yeah, here you go. 
why? 
cartman, uh, all i was trying to tell you at wall-mart was that you-
oh no!
you don't need that! get off of it.
that's not what i meant by doing something about it, cartman!
what??
so take a shit somewhere else!
what's going on down here?
can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, mr. broflovski. doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  i'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  well, i'm off to go try to take a shit at best buy, guys. see you, kyle. 
okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- oh...
i don't have legs.
yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'scuse me. move it.
the government warns that rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. to counter the crisis, the department of health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. 
you have got to be kidding me!
we should not be wasting time and money making sure cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
so get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
come on, hurry it up in there! 
alright, you son of a bitch! i'll take you to hell! 
i'm sorry token, i had to tell him. his life is in danger.
yeah, but don't worry. it didn't do so good. we got killed in the ratings by honey boo boo.
well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
our country is in the midst of an epidemic. recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  a conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. what will we do as a country? i cannot give you any easy answers. but what i can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! honey boo boo versus fatty poo poo! 
that's good, fatty, get pissed!
yeah, fatty!
ow!
we need to realize obesity is an epidemic. but it's not a disease. from now on i'm going to dedicate this administration to fighting childhood obesity! 
whoa!
i don't know. i feel like i should confront my mom first. but it's so embarrassing.
what?
cartman dude, not now.
and so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. i'm afraid those are not secure at all.
oh, i'm sorry, but i really don't think i can afford this.
yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
we realize that's a lot of money, mrs. cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
stan, you got something from amazon.  oh.  ooohhh shit.
this is jeff with wolf home security. is everything all right?
that's okay. do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
okay, i've got something a little different here.
no problem.
it's all right, it happens all the time.
you want to rape your mom?
you said you lived there.
hey, ey uh,  you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!
this is michael with wolf home security. is everything all right?
oh-kay, should we contact the police?
okay, we're contacting them now.
try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
thought we wouldn't find out??? 
please! 
hello, this is varashnu wit wolf home security.
...uh yes, i am in united states.
okay, hold on. 
this is kevin with wolf home security. is everything all right?
we have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. that takes a lot of employees manning phones.
sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
i d-i d'uh... wow, that just fucked my head.
i know...
what?!
nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
the jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! it's growing!
this is marcus with insecurity. is everything all right?
all right, could i just get your password please?
i love boobs?
how did you know that?
oh oh i get it. that's pretty funny.
sure, here you go. 
ho- hold on one second, sir, i have another emergency coming in.  this is brian with insecurity, is everything all right?
hello, this is martin with insecu-
doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  ah! who are you??
hoo!
what?
butters?  why?
you're talking about butters.
you just think you know everything, don't you kyle?! every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about his image!  you guys think cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? you're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  the only kid here with any sense of dignity is kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
and that's another thing! you're always trivializing everything i say by gettin' the last word! well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
"not an emo chick on her period, butters. like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. all hawaiians feel it. it is called ""hapahui apahoha"", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. you must do your walkabout to your homeland, butters. and you must do it alone.  take this, son. it is our mahalo rewards card. it will provide you with all you need. and now i must turn my back on you. "
what?
hawaii?
(i'm not his best friend.)
oh hey eric and kenny. you guys don't have costumes?

oh, let's go to the petersons' house.
oh wuhow! look honey, it's iron man, captain america, thor, and bruce vilanch. 
oh, what are you supposed to be? oh  oh, right. you're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 
ohhh, cute!

somebody's breaking into that kum & go.
stan and kyle, you take the back entrance. cartman and i will block him from the side.

sounds like you're talking about the red box killers. they've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from red boxes.
it's all right, just a scratch.
okay, roll up your sleeve. 
i don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
did you do it?
(i told you it was a bad idea.)
"yeah, and so, and so then, i asked preacher, ""well, what about the new testament?"""
"and he says, ""well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to jesus' name whenever it comes up."""
all right all right, i got it a few weeks ago. big whoop.
yeah i know.

okay, mr. thompson, voting line is right over there.  next, please. 
oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?
this little boy lost his mom.

"""warm nuts"", she said."
warm nuts, sir? warm nuts?
no way dude. no way.
would you like warm nuts, sir? 
ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
don't be sad, ike. just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  hello?
nothing, watching the election results.
what?!
alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
it doesn't matter if i am or not. people voted and i stand behind the president.
sure you do!
chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
what the hell is this?
i don't believe it.
why do you have these?
dude!
knock it off, cartman!
you're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
sweetie, there's a mr. pun li tsiao on the phone for you?
eric cartman? we have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
you mind if we search your room?
let's just see.

more melted butter, sir?
little boy, the president is on his way to pick up the ballots. where are they?!
alter our... the president will be here in moments with what we want!
all right, where are the missing ballots?!  president obama?
because every time i show up and explain something, i earn a freckle. 
that was not the deal! we will not be a-bullied by you!
what's this about a deal with the chinese?! i own all this shit now! i own the death star! i own tatooine! it's all mine, haha! all right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? haha.
i didn't say anything. i promise.
please, eric! i tried to be quiet, i swear!
go on! leave us alone! haha.  now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. every vote counts. and you need-
why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! it will make your death a lot less painful! haha.
pretty neat, huh? how would you like to have one?
like what?!
well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? if you wanna be in the next star wars, i'm your guy! haha.
you can be luke's son, you can be han solo's son, i don't give two shits and a popsicle.
sure thing. i've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
haha.
i am tired of playing games! this little farce is ovah! 
oh my god. are those what i think they are?
nothing sir. we just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. barkley out. 
i am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! blabbin' pussy little skank! why do people talk on their phone like that?! i can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! you're not that important!
how many hours were you guys playing?
you were playing football?
that is not what happened! you totally started crying and quit the game!
is that that same kid?
how do we have a choice?!
my dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
yeah.
yeah, we're ditching school.
me and toby are ditching school!
i don't think so.
that'd be cool.
that'd be cool.
"i know, right?  a big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! i'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  i seriously feel like i'm being spied on right now.  i'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  hang on, i'm gonna make a video blog for my ""stop listening to me"" web site.  what's up everybody? it's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. there's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  you guys gonna update your blogs too?"
i said i got your tweet and the address!
yeah, i'm here, bro.
will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
ww-ww-what's the n s a?
hello?? hey government... it's me... butters. ah i just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...an and please watch over mommy, and daddy, ah an and my friends stan and kyle, craig and token, and and even ol' eric cartman. uh i know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. goodnight, government.  oh yeah.  ah, and thank you, president obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. and if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  i'd really like to get a puppy for christmas this year.  'night, government. 
they're spying on you?
like what?
naw, don't do that.
you need that new thing where you don't need to type.
you haven't seen the alec baldwin commercial?
you're okay with everything you think going up on the internet?
how many people are on shitter?
can i help you sir?
all right, and your name?
i don't see you on the list, mr. clinton.
uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
i am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
right this way, bill. welcome to the nsa main office.
some little faggot in my head.
the more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
huh?
"ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but central computer designated his status as ""fat and unimportant."""
shut up! sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! i'll put a stop to this! 
not according to the central computer.
sorry,  but if central computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. 
there's 300 million people out there. how do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? how do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?
alright, i'll show you. but this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. then our enemies would do it. we can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
this is how we know who's a threat and who's not. how we know who's sleeping and who's awake.  how we know that...
"hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on msnbc, ""free pass with alec baldwin"""
eric, honey, what's the matter?
i know that the nsa is torturing santa, sweetie. but they're keeping us safe.
honey, it's okay.
no, you don't have to fly to russia, hon.
no, it will be fine. how about i make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
hello. how would you like to know the truth?
it's time to let go, eric. don't you see there's no other way? just let the government into your heart.
it's never too late. there's a place where you can start over. 
your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
yes.
yes!
that's right.
we've got a new member today! eric cartman, do you love your country?!
do you pledge allegiance to the flag?!
unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from syria should be considered in need-
refugees from syria should be considered in need of international protection.
the vast majority of refugees from syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
murder porn?
what's up dude?
yhh, yeah, the first grader?
this is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
that's impossible. are you guys sure you set it up right?
what?
alright, alright, let's calm down! i know we're all concerned here!
you know why! because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
i have to agree with cartman. maybe we overreacted when our parents-
aw, go to hell, you griefer!
what, dude?
so?
(i knew you're up to something!)
i love you too babe.  oh!
nothing.
yeah.
uh, i'm just gettin' ready for cla-
he's doing it a-gain.
i uhhh, have band practice.
cartman, are you feeling alright?
alright, now the french revolution was basically started by a young man named marius. , who only knew jean valjean as an older man, and uh-  ...uh, the french government at the time was led by javert, who was trying to-
eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
and why do you think token is a tickin' time bomb?
do you think he blames you for somethin'?
wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? in a poem? uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to token?
well eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. m'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. m'kay?
m'kay, you sure? because i'm here when you need me.
m'kay.
no! nonono!  nooo! 
i'm good.
that's awesome. i'm so stoked that we're best friends.  fist bump.  fist bump. 
okay, really?
now eric, whatever it is you and token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? the problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. agreed?
okay. token, come on in, please. 
token, i've been talkin' with eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. you have some things you wanna say, eric?
...what jury?
i don't know what to say.
this isn't a poem. it doesn't even rhyme.
eric, do you feel better about all this?
okay, thanks token. 
ho-oh.
ho ho!
alright, that's enough!  you think i should feel bad for you because of the trayvon martin verdict?!
what the hell is wrong with you?! why are you all here listening to this?!
oh god here it comes! get down everybody! get down now! 
get inside! 
what's going on?!
an airport?! but...?
now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
which one?
my god, what's going on out there?
maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
what contagion? my wife didn't get on the plane.  take this plane back to denver!
what about los angeles? can we take the plane to los angeles?
you got a better idea, asshole?!
yes, let him think!
oh, i'm just finishing up.
hey!
no, the plane crashed. we're in the colorado mountains somewhere.  matt? matt?!  my husband. he said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
help! help me!  please, i have two little girls in chicago. please find them!
and there must be... a patient zero... the person it all starts from.
we have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
you have to! you have to be strong. if you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it.  promise me! promise... me!
oh my god! oh my god!
yes!
can i help you?
alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  what is it you intend to shoot?
...you mean a person who's threatening you?
well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
"you can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. well unless of course you're in a state that has a ""stand your ground"" law."
"see now with a ""stand your ground"" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not."
"no, no, see, you've gotta be in a state with a ""stand your ground"" law, like florida."
what?! what is it, please?! hurry, my husband might still be alive!
the other way to stop the outbreak. token isn't the only patient zero. the outbreak won't happen if... we shoot george zimmerman. we have to get to florida!
this plane is going to baltimore.
if we don't get to florida there's not going to be a baltimore left!  black guy in the back!  alight, now let's find zimmerman.
what are we going to do?
what if he attacks us first?
well, at least i'll bet token's glad it's over with. aren't you, token? 
you made everyone think i'm a fucking patient zero!
so what?!
fuck you!
oh! 
what's up girls? daddy did it!
you're having nightmares about the ending to world war z again?
that's what bothering you? not the fact that you're a murderer?
you're a murderer.
eric cartman to the counselor's office please.
oh man! 
well he was technically standing his ground, token.
well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
and why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
"students, i would like to introduce you all to the future.  m'kay. starting today, our school will be operating entirely on intellilink.  now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  m'kay...  you can use a computer or any of the intellilink panels which are located throughout the school.  lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. you start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. you just click on ""school clinic"" mkay, see nurse. m'kay. respiration problems.  uh, okay, i must have i must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. as you can see, you can control the sound system as well. okay.  it's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. let's look at the message board.  mesage... board.  here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? for instance,  here we go. here's a message from kyle's little brother, ike broflovski.  okay, little ike says ""my brother is a homo"" ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  it's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off kyle's head there."
he doesn't even let me near him!
what??
yaaaay!
about what?!
where did you find a red-haired cow?
oh would you- would you guys like to see it?
whoa, look at it!
wow, that's pretty trippy.
alright, cartman, joke's over. 
tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
boy eric, i sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
let's go get the kindergartners. uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
don't touch it! 
cartman, stop! you don't know what you're doing!
after all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the middle east. in the past 48 hours, jews, muslims, and christians have met in israel to sort out their differences. it may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. and all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the u.s. we'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. 
yeah. 
no shit!
well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
oh no. nohoho no. cartman, don;t you do this! the middle east is finally at peace!
dude, go to hell!
you're a fat skank, mom. 
you're a fat skank, mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
ohh my god!  ms. broflovski, are you okay? does he always talk to you like that?
i just... thought it'd be nice.
yes sir.
yes.  i love cartman's farts.
yummy yummy yummy can i please cartman's farts in my tummy?
yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
well kyle, that's kind of odd. uh, not sure how to help you with that.
not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
please...
this is cartman. i have to take it.  hello?
i don't care.
what can this reporter say except that israel freaking rocks! things just keep getting better here, tom. and in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!
yes! yes i will!
yes, whatever you want. 
and now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, eric cartman, and his best friend, fartboy. 
could i please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
we are associating with these heathens for no reason!
but that is what happened! it is! tell them, cartman!
but it's the truth!
ssso it was all for nothing. the whole time i was... eating farts for nothing.
that's enough!  our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! those of you who signed up are to be... commended.  but i warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors!  winter is coming.
(she's not here right now.)
please tell her there is to be a meeting in the great hall. i have found a way to get xbox ones, and the fair lady mccormick will want to hear about it.
which nobody can afford.
if you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
black friday? come on, that can't be real.
it is real. they do it every year. but everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on black friday. what chance do we have?
tom, the south park mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. one thing's for sure, people take black friday very seriously.
wizard cartman! i have news from the internet, my lord! 
uh, sorry, i haven't watched it yet.
larry and brad stoltsky
hey yeah, i know.  how about we ask those kids who play star trek?
well wizard cartman, i started watching game of thrones.
well it's it's pretty good, i guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
yeah, i know. winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. i'm pretty excited for that. just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
wait, wait. what are you talking about, xbox ones? 
i thought we were getting playstation 4's.
m ma um m-me too.
look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
they're not better, they're just more expensive.
yeah!
we're still gonna fight on black friday, just not with you!
i know.
on screen. 
nothin' much. we're just about to check out a class m planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
just find out who they're loyal to.
given the xbox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for starfleet.
cheap xbox ones? for real?
i don't know.
oh don't even get me started! i keep watchin' that show and i'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! but all i get is wiener, wiener, wiener. it's not all gay wiener, but when they do show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! why is that? because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
twitter says they're introducing a new elmo doll this christmas.
come on, sir stan. there must be kids somewhere who will join us. 
(yes. what's up, my lord?)
(but stan and kyle are best friends)
(yes. that's right.) 
hey, you damned kids!  get the hell out of my yard!
"what's going to be the big item everyone goes for this black friday? it just might be the playstation 4. sony has just announced they offering a special black friday bundle, called the ""brack friday bunduru,"" which will include four controllers, a map of japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for metal gear solid v. no doubt sony has just raised the stakes."
yeah, but, why can't xbox automatically let you pre-order metal gear solid v?
en garde! 
aaah god ow sorry...
cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
it's not enough! ever since kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with ps4 on black friday.
cartman released the ps4s cartman. they're being reviewed. people are liking them.
i guarantee you kenny had something to do with sony offering a brack friday bunduru!  just keep them in training, sir kyle. two can play at kenny's backstabbing game. 
smartasses. 
you mean princess kenny, m'lord?
they don't!
yeah, i finished it!
nothing! the dragons are just still on their way! they keep promising dragons, but all i get are more floppy wieners in my face!
wha-what do you want me to do?
who's george r. r. martin?
hey! i told you kids to stay out of my damned yard!
yeah?! well home come every time you talk to somebody. it's about betraying somebody else?!
come on in! i'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in game of thrones. 
if you want to make sure i'm not switching sides, cartman, you don't have to worry. stan is wrong.
grounded? for what?
no, cartman. you said nobody will have to be grounded. we're not playing dirty!
what?
don't believe it!  he said that to a bunch of people!
you're callin' the cops?!
you're on my property! i'm callin' the cops!
yes?
uh, yeah, kenny's out back playing with his friends.
protect the princess! kill 'em! kill 'em! get out!
the princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
the princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that playstations are better, she'll consider it.
the princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
i would rather game with craig than spend one minute having to set up an xbox live account! we will get our playstations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
ehhh...
certainly. uh, eric, right?
oh i certainly don't wanna step on your toes. don't worry, i'm quite good at letting my ceos do what they want.
let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting xboxes. the rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
hahaa! how's it feel?! now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
aaaaah! 
apparently, he stopped microsoft from blockading the shipment of ps4s to the mall. looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for sony.
cartman, he's got everyone on sony's side. we can't stop him!
sweetie, bill gates is on the phone for you.
this would have never happened if you would have let kenny be a princess in the first place!
well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! we are out of options!
go ahead and tell him, cartman.
haha.
so, better a ps4 than nothing, is that it? i think we'll take our chances on our own. 
ha? ueddingu? 
ahh, kawaii! 
yeah, sure, what about it?
why?
oh, okay i guess that makes sense, but... butters and scott won't be able to get their ps4s.
he's lying to you!  they're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!
they're gonna betray you at the red robin wedding! he got the idea watching game of thrones!
who is that?
they're gonna lock you in!
he talked about it in my garden to like three other people! they're gonna lock you in the red robin and go get all the xboxes! that's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
did kyle know about this?
did kyle know about this?!
fuck you, get out of my garden!
what's that?  awww! 
uh, i heard a rumor. may i ask, who is it that's getting married?
it's, it's real? it's for real? oho my god, i love them!
so beyoncé is not with jay-z anymore?
uh, guys, guys, not those tables. get the good tables. this is vip, okay?
cartman, cartman! i heard that stan somehow found out about our plan!
well what the hell are you doing?! this isn't gonna work now!
what the hell did you do??
oh great, go right on in. 
the mall isn't open yet. they're waiting for george r. r. martin to come cut the ribbon.
yeah, come on!
princess kenny, i believe it's time we returned the wizard's hospitality! 
i'm sorry, cartman. there's been a little change in plans!
i am no longer an xbox guy! i let my friend get grounded, but today i will give him a playstation!
it's not over. looks like i came just in time.
wait a minute. ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
no. they're not a part of your betrayal?
winner take all!
this... is over... now... you die!  it's over. xbox... wins! 
happy holidays, guys. what can i interest ya in? 
tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like microsoft's new xbox one is this year's hot item. no doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. black friday is over. there's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is channel 9 news.
yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. 
cartman? your side won, dude. why are you so sad?
yeah, i know what you mean. well look, guys, xbox won the console wars, i mean, what are we gonna do? not play video games?
yeah, you're right. you make a point.
yeah!
at least she didn't try to sit on him. 
uh-huh. uh-huh, that's right
lisa? lisa berger? anybody seen lisa berger?  oh hey, eric. have you seen lisa berger anywhere?
ii know! i'm gonna tell her i love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
what?! well since when?
wow! wow! she looks great!
yeah. clearly annie nelson is the hottest girl at our school. look at those eyes!
google him. he's this guy from sweden who has over 30 million youtube subscribers. we didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. it just seems so lame.
yeah. you used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. someone who just comments on stuff. i mean, really? who would even want to do that?! 
all i wanted was to play one level of call of duty and you know what ike told me? he said the living room was for old people.
i don't get it. the whole fun of call of duty is that you get to do the shooting.
(commentary?)
of course not.  anything to keep you away from cock magic.
hey ike, you wanna come watch tv with me?
all i wanted was to play one level of call of duty and you know what ike told me? he said the living room was for old people.
i don't get it. the whole fun of call of duty is that you get to do the shooting.
ike, that is enough! if you're interested in call of duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
what do you think you're doing?!
you know what i mean! why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
this fat fuck thinks he's pewdiepie! because of him i can't get ike to come out of his room!
let's plays?
well it's a really great game. the characters are so rich.
so i guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are youtube commentators. just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. isn't that crazy??  well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. please welcome cartmanbrah! 
so can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you do?
and why do you think young people-?
...why do you think young people are responding to this?  i'm asking you a question! 
oh my gosh, honey look it's tupac! i told you them homies didn't cap his ass!  oh, this is going on instagram! 
tell me about it.
you know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and they were the ones commenting on whatever was on tv.
do you mind?!
dude! nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
what is happening to our living rooms? there is a crisis in america, and-
it's cartman's stupid online persona!
what the hell?
it's true!
there is a crisis in america! as families grow further and further apart-
this is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
eric cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? eric cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
eric, i've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
eric, i am talking to you!
it's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. what we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. we have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in american culture. how would you like to be in charge of it all?
glad you feel that way. we have a lot to do together. we're about to take this to a whole new level.
ooohh, i love whole new levels! this is gonna be so totally awesome! cartmaaanbrah!
barking vaginal belch.
(dilapidated titties incorporated.)
sorry.
i told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. there's a lot of startup company these days. 
...nnnno, there isn't. 
what?
what?! tell us!
washington redskins?
i'm pretty sure that's taken, cartman.
what?!
wait. guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
yeah, i just... well i just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
(yahoo!) 
no way!
i dunno, i just. uh. they don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. i dunno, i thought it was funny.
it's called crowd-funding, using the internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
you are eric cartman?
my name is dan snyder. i'm the president and owner of the washington redskins
thank you, but i will stand.
young man, we ask that you please stop using the name washington redskins for your organization.
because we are the washington redskins, and we are a football team! you have no right to use our name to get attention!
"look! don't you see that when you call your organization ""the washington redskins"", its offensive to us?"
makes us feel like a joke
uh, i know i can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 
guys, we need to talk to you. i really don't think we wanna be a company that isis looks up to. we should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
people aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
that's the catholic church!
that's the nfl!
all right, i really don't want to have to do this, but... i'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
maybe i'll start my own company.
i don't want to! it's a stupid name! 
yeah. i guess... i guess everything is.
i don't know, i... but i don't know if my future is with this company either.
thank god!
huh? 
happy deadline day!
oh boy, this is like christmas morning!
somebody raided kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
somebody killed kickstarter!
"what the hell is wrong? ""can't find the server"" kickstarter. "
what?!
no, i just can't get it to load.
my company was on kickstarter too! why would i get rid of it?!
he's right. we should do a merger.
"yes we do! we have a sweet name.  i was wrong, cartman. ""washington redskins"" is the perfect name. i think maybe i was jealous that i didn't come up with it."
whattaya say, cartman?
when kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at washington redskins, we saw opportunity. people still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the redskins you can now go fund yourself.  and the idea is simple. you, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the washington redskins 5%.
we finally did it!
what the heck is that? 
well what the hell do we do?
morning!
sup, jason? 
what are you guys doing here?
but you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
i'm happy, stan. i'm happy i know who you really are now. you're someone who can't be counted on! you're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
"doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""i'm sorry"" anymore?"
(right. what the fuck is going on?)
(a party?!)
dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
hey, that might work. but it can't be a party for us.
for someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
no no, he's right! we've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
yeah, he said some guy at work is lorde's uncle or something.
(this will be awesome!)
yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, scott malkinson. is that correct?
i actually have plans this weekend.
all the pizza we can eat?
yeah, i swear, if i hear another person talking about being gluten-free i'm gonna piss in their face.
hey cartman.
dude, calm down.
who took all the pizza and the cake?  what the hell?
cartman? come on, dude. you have to get up.
we can't let our party suck.
i'll be back. 
cartman, we can't do this alone. you have to get up.
hello, eric.  come on over here, sugar.
there's people in trouble, eric. they need to be shown the way.
you need to get to the usda, child. they're lookin' for a sign.
when you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
they've got it wrong, child!  the world is upside down.
tell then they've got's it backwards!
they've got what backward? 
ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is eric. are you there, eric?
cartman?
who is this?
the pyramid? that's ancient stuff you're talking about. are you sure?  bring up the pyramid! 
the pyramid down't work. we already tried it.
what?
we really dodged a bullet, young man. thanks to you, america knows what to eat again.
we're gonna get a better view of the stage.
we love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause i am lorde. i am lorde. lorde lorde lorde lorde yeah yeah yeah.
are you okay, cartman?
hey eric! i'm not suspended no more.
i think someone's in there.
occupied.
you can't call dibs on a toilet.
then don't eat 14 egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
what the hell do you think you're doing?
this is the girls bathroom!
what?!
get out of here!
cartman is using our bathroom!
hey! i'm gonna tell on you!
i want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
you are not transgender, eric! you don't even know what that means!
all right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. is that right?!
alright, listen eric!
listen eric! you must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
yeah! recess is almost over!
not while you're in here!
eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
erica, i believe we have a solution to this little problem.
if it is agreeable to you, erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
would that be agreeable to you?
wendy, just go with it!
yeah, just go with it, wendy, cisginger bitch! of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. i might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
you know, because you've already got ac over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
he's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. but he would die for me. 
hey cartman. heard you're transgender.
holy moly! 
it's cool. i'll wait.
dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
i'm sorry erica, but i spoke with wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
you'll just have to share, eric. why can't you understand that?
i thought you were a chick.
no! i identify as a chick, but i'm still a boy. you can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  that is my waterfall, and those are my christmas lights!
what?
just hold it. that's what i do now. 
hey, what the fuck dude?! god fucking damn it!
i, i just... two people close to me are having gender identity issues and i'm, i'm confused.
"it's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer lorde. the singer went dark on twitter claiming severe depression, and stating  ""i realize now that i make people uncomfortable. i need to give this up and go back to just being the old me."" spin magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week."
yeah, what's the big idea harassing erica, stan?!
awe, come on, lay off him guys.
and so it is with great pride that i can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
loo looloo loo loo loo loo, loo looloo loo loo.
hey eric, i'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that i took.
i don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
my dad and i shot it yesterday at the lake.
you can see the momma bird fly in.
we took all kinds of video with his drone.
you know, those drone thingies. you can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
your dad has a fucking drone?
it can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. and it can take video the entire time right to your phone. don't touch the propellers.
are you crazy?! this is my dad's drone!
my dad said it's not for spying on people.
oh he'll know. you can hear it take off.
butters?
comin' dad! 
yes, it's me.
of course not!
what?! you said nobody would know!
be careful! the powerlines!
okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
let me see!
jeeeeezz!
(yeah.)
what do i do?!
i don't know what to do!
i love you too, dad. 
(yeah, i know, dude.)
i know. 
sup? 
what?
that's horrible. if that's true, i don't wanna see it.
let me see.
how'd you get that on your phone?
that's terrible!
what the heck are you doing?!
when did you put craig's mom's bush on the internet?!
you promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
why?!
i should have never listened to you! ah i should have known this would get out of hand!
are you happy now?!
is, is this? do you think this is cool?
see, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
i was in the bathroom when you were talking to butters, cartman!  i know what-
i was in the bathroom-
no, i was taking a crap, and i heard you guys talking!
how is that spying?!
are you out of your mind?! what are you doing?!
"why would you turn ""craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!"
why can't you leave it alone?! why can't you just stop?!
why?!
that poor lady. her vagina is everywhere. poor craig.
my name is stephen willis stotch. the drone that took the video of craig's mom... was my drone. i didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. at this point, i have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  all of you with drones, please listen to me. three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the internet. we all were told to respectfully not watch the video. but on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  we have to find a way to get rid of them! before they get rid of us!
do you remember when i showed you the video of the little bird eggs? well that's the last time i felt happy.
i have to tell the truth. i want you and kenny to come with me and tell craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
i don't want anymore discussions, eric! i don't want anymore excuses!
i just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
i don't want all these drones everywhere! nobody does!
you do?
what?
no! there is no way i'm gonna-
time to end this hobby once and for all!  no! noooo!
if this doesn't work, we're dead.
"but then when drones were filling the sky,
she unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
craig's mom's bush, craig's mom's bush.
gargantuan thicket of madness.
bigger than earth and denser than gold.
truly a magical bush to behold."
craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
no! nono! i'm sorry. thank you eric! i screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! thanks for covering my ass!
it's still stupid and now i paid 49 cents for it!
we're playing the terrance & phillip freemium game.
well yeah, i was sick in bed. what else was i gonna do?
you guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
waitwaitwait, jimmy told you about this game?
dude, what?!
(yeah!)
i just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
but you accepted money from the canadian government! to push a freemium game on us! why would they do that?!
how do you get people addicted to crack? you give it away for free. you give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
it's a figure of speech with crippled people. we'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
we have to find a way to get the word out! people need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! there has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their tv signal. if we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
wuh, what's done?
yeah. yeah, i think i'm gonna be okay. 
i feel stan! he looks totally real!
the school and all the kids.  i still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
ah, okay uh, i think i'm done, eric. ah i'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
what what what?
oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! i forgot!
i'm sorry!
yeah.
okay, i'm back in your room!
suppornity window dropped. 
wow! that was cool!
i touched wendy's boobs. 
sound pretty typical to me.
coup de grah, cartman
poor butters. can't you just leave him alone?
hey eric! what'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  not that we were doing anything interesting. right eric? 
"you know what i said? she asked me why i wasn't in school and i said ""well, technically i was in school."" tee hee. sorry guys, but eric and i know a little something you don't. not that it's anything that cool. right eric?"
yeah. 
see? he's an asshole. fuck him.
well, not a hundred percent...
okay, subject is ready.
interim status is go.
it worked! i'm back in. all systems normal.
going now! 
how much more of this am i supposed to clear up?
okay. it's so realistic.  the snow looks kind of fake though.  alright, i think that's all of it.
there's an old fat lady here! she's holding out money for me!
okay, i got it!
already? oh no!
huh, that was incredible!
what the hell are you doing, kid?!
whoa! huh, i'm in the car now
hahaha, i'm in the bad part of town! i just hit a lamp post! ah, ah-i'm back on my feet. oh, oh that's cool. there's a prostitute out here.
i'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
i'm taking your money! ow. oh she stabbed me. uh the hooker stabbed me.
i can't  i can't breathe too good. eric, i can't see. are you still there? oh... i think i overdid it. i have to take this thing off. what the hell? what the hell is that?! aaah!
i wonder how long i'm grounded for?
ahhh!
eric! uh what are you doing here?
what?
nuh uh!
what?? 
aghah. okay, stop! stooop!
ah how do you know that?!
o-kay. 
no!
well? are you happy, cartman? butters is completely traumatized!
hello, eric. my name is steve from oculus customer service. there seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, i would like to apologize and try to help.
this is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
you should probably listen to him, dude.
the people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
maybe we are.
i know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
oh no, mister! you are grounded! 
...what? what do you mean?
i don't know what you mean.
eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
oh really? oh, that's a relief.
oh gosh!
oh gosh!
yeah.
uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. could you try that, my friend? 
hey cartman, i need to talk to you.
cartman, i'm going to tell you something, and i need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
alright, here it goes. cartman, you aren't really here.
because i saw you. okay? in your room, passed out, with a vr headset on. customer service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why i'm here.
i know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
www-what do you mean?
fuck you!
don't... do that!
no! i put your headset on, and came here to-
no. then i came into this virtual space.
fuck you! why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
yes. my name is kyle broflovski. can you tell me if i purchased an oculus rift headset there?
dude... what?
yes, hello. this call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
holy shit. then this is all real. we've all been here from the beginning. taking turns on the oculus rift headset.
how do you know?
god damn it cartman!
he's lying.
yes.
okay, i'm back in cartman's room.
hey guys.  thanks. support your team? thank you. hey guys. did you get one of these?  hope you can make it.
the girls volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
what's wrong with supporting girls athletics?!
dude, kenny is fighting slaughterhouse tonight. i mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
not with his shapeshifter. it already attacked.
what's that?
nnoohhh!
it was seriously almost hard to watch. 
pfft whatever.
hey! pssst!  come over here.  you guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
well then, if you wanna see real fights with real brutality, go here.  this is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  and you might wanna pack a barf bag.
should be the next one. 2778 mala vista drive. wait, this is city wok.
(what?)
okay, come on, come on, five darra, five darra each! come on, five darra!
the mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! it's mass calcify against into the void!
that was freakin' hardcore.
it was really about the most man thing i think we've ever been a part of.
hell yeah! 
what's mean about it?
yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
(no.)
dude, totally. with kenny's magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
what is it?!
they're fuckin' chickens.
free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
then he's perfect for us.
hey mcnuggets. you wanna come play for us?
yeah!
all right mcnuggets!  did we pick the right rooster or what?!
excuse me. that was pretty impressive down there. you boys have a nice cock.
gee, thanks!
where was all this?
thank you, mr. garrison. listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against evergreen. the girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. jokes are hard and require skill.
hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. thanks. 
this is it. 1421 plaza de estereotipo.
sorry, panda express is crosed. we crosed!
oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.
for the next round, it is gadnuk, breaker of worlds, versus clucky
what do you mean? is he a red mage or a green mage?
mcnuggets is scared. he doesn't wanna play.
he doesn't have a choice
what do you think all these people are here to see?
and a warm welcome back to the cock magic championships. certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of panda express. the fight we were expecting, of course, gadnuk, breaker of worlds versus ten-month-old cornish rooster mcnuggets. in a complete shocker, the challenger mcnuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old kenny mccormick. never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock magic. let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for gadnuk's sixth move.  gadnuk, breaker of worlds plays a creature card. 
what did he play? did he tap all his mana?
he just had to shuffle it.
and now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the amazingly randi! 
all right, a hand for detective harris!  you know, if there's one thing i could leave you all with, it's this. let cock magic be done by the professionals.  sir? 
yeah, it was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
"it's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
this younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
what's trending to them is trenders who trend on youtube."
and featuring live commentary the entire show by cartmanbrah.
please, tune in and help get america's families back in the living room.
it's all live and it's all magical. it's the washington redskins go fuck yourself holiday special.
nnnothing, nothing.
not yet, but tupac is close to hunting him down.
"sir, i'm pretty sure that  ""washington redskins go fuck yourself holiday special"" is not a good name."
if i may be frank, sir, i think you're giving this kid a little too much power!
people, you know what we're trying to do here.  we're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. that means being hip, being now.
"there, you see that? ""blumpkin catchers."" do any of you even know what that means? this kid is our way to connect with the youth of america, and i'm gonna give him all the power he needs."
cartman, open this door right now!
what the hell are you doing?!
come out here and talk to me face to face! open this door!
"because you just said, ""here in my room""!"
cartman, please! we have to stop this show! lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
because lorde is my dad, alright?!  lorde is my dad.
he does it all with computers and processors... he got discovered on the internet. he's like the pewdiepie of music. and he played live last week. rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. i thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
and now, live via hologram, it's kurt cobain.

thanks for all the shoutouts. i guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.
god damn it, get out of here!
this show is getting kind of boring, bros. what do you say we change it out to something more exciting?
i know! let's play call of duty! 
ohhh yeah! this is more like it, bros!
okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. let's get rid of him!
ike, you can't come to school with me. 
well, i don't know...  and i'll bet cartman doesn't know either!
well, what?
(it's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 
whoa, cartman! looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
really? what about?
totally!
that wasn't a dream cartman, those were visitors!
yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
well, today it's salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
yeah, fat boy saw it!
oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
oh! did they give you an anal probe?
whoa! they gave you an anal probe cartman?
dude, they did, huh? aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
eneh probe
well, i gotta get to the cafeteria. you children watch that fat boy now. he could be under alien control. 
we told you they were real cartman. sorry to hear about your ass.
why are you walkin' so funny cartman?
cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
what am i going to do? my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  you farted. 
no, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  it's true! ask cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
damn it!
damn, cartman!
it's the alien anal probe. it's shooting fire from cartman's rectum!
eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
ya, seriously, killer.
how can you eat when you're farting fire?
where? 
shut up, fat ass! i don't even like her!
whoa! maybe you can kiss her.
mr. garrison won't let us out of school. he thinks we're making it up.
whoa! 
it's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  this could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
we got out of schoolno more school todaywe got out of school...
okay, cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
he is under alien control. that thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
ah, son of a bitch!
hey!
if you visitors can hear me- 
-bring me back my little brother, god damnit!
now do you believe us, cartman?
cartman, they killed kenny!
dude, kenny is dead!  see?
he's dead, cartman! 
go on and go home, you fat chicken!
hello, eric.
how are you doing?
here, i made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
you're not fat, you're big boned.
you can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
just a weensy geensy woo woo?
how about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
yes, hon?
sure, hon. you want some cheesy poofs, too?
as the reports of ufo sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around south park. these crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns.

well, then. i know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with mommy tonight.
meow.
meow.
eric, look who's here.
come on eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
that's okay, eric, i think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
don't be difficult, eric! now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
god damn it! 
don't be such a fraidy cat, cartman. this rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
i think we have to signal them somehow.
yeah! all you have to do is fart some more, cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
come on cartman, fart!
fart, damn you!
now, do you believe this, cartman?
cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
oh, boy. the aliens are going to make first contact. hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  and you've only got 20 minutes before sanford and son is on.
moo moo, moo. moo moo, moo. moo. (we have experimented with all the beings of earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)
moo moo. moo moo. (farewell cows, peace be with you!)
"ha ha cows! i've got you cornered. let's see you get away now. 
i love to sing-a
about the moon-a and the june-a and the spring-a
i love to sing-a
about a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
wow cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
really, what about?
that wasn't a dream, cartman. that really happened.
cartman, you do have pinkeye!
yeah, it was huge.
yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
what were you talking about?
no, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
what?
congratulations eric, on writing the award winning paper.
that's impossible, cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
wow, what did you write about cartman?
my paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
ouch.  thank you.
yeah, cause cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
children, as you all know, kathie lee gifford will be in south park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
who cares? now kids, what's say we give it our south park best.  and who's our little prize winner again?
how about we get in shape, huh? we want to look our best for the tv cameras don't we?
yes ma'am. i'm gonna be on television, i'm gonna be on television.
we don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
dolphins are way smarter than you!
dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!
tell me what you wrote about!
yeah, right! you'll go and sit in front of the tv and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!

what? you've got to weight 90 pounds.
yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
what's that stuff?
superfatass?
whoa, cartman. talk about wide load.
you're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
"cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""god damn it, that's a big fat ass!"""
god damn, that's a big fat ass!
hi guys.
shut up cartman!
where is she?
mr. garrison. he's going to try to kill kathie lee gifford.
he's got a gun!
and now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, eric kaufman...
it is with great honor and pride that i present the winner his trophy. eric, would you please come up here?
i guess that's it, guys. wrap it up.
forget it kid. no kathie lee, no public interest.
obesity, adiposity, corpulence... whatever word you use, it represents one thing: being a big fat ass. we have with us today, live via satellite, eric cartman from south park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.
is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
now you be careful, eric. the woods can be very dangerous.
be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 
and i know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 
you give your mommy a kissy.
don't get scared up in the mountains cartman.
oh, ho, that's disgusting.
that's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
well, here we are. okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
cartman always makes stuff up, ned. you can't believe anything he says.
wow, that'd be cool.
you see boys, the democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
ohho, it's a deer. looks like about a .46 gauge, ned. it's coming right for us!

yeah,  it's stupid. let's go watch cartoons.
good dog, sparky. who's my best buddy? who's the boy? who's the buddy?
he's part doberman and part wolf. he's the toughest dog on the mountain.
he's not meaner than sparky.
sparky'll kick his ass.
that's it, sparky! kick his ass! 
what?!
what do you mean?
sick, shut up dude. 
who's middle park?
oh my god! what is he doing to my dog?
get down sparky! down!
gay dog. 
"thank you for that presentation eric, but the assignment was on asian cultures. you get a ""d-""."
"excellent. ""a-""."
wow, cool!
eric, stanley just might lead our team to victory against the middle park cowboys for the first time in decades. and we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.
life isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.
good, i'm glad we could have this little talk stanley. now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
you're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the cowboys.
bark, bark.
i don't know.
oolala 
who cares if your dog is gay? maybe it's not that bad.
i got cut off for marty's stupid movie reviews.
i don't know where sparky is. he usually follows me to football practice.
i think he might've run away.
yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.
cartman farted!
ah, dude, weak.
but it was here. it was all right here. the, there was a techno dance club.
mroo- 
nothing, i mu-i mean, nowhere.
no!
yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, stan.
my parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  they think she's all innocent and sweet, but i know that she's an evil bitch!
no it's not cool!  my mom won't let me keep him in the house.  she says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  see ya. 
sit down kid!!!
we can use cartman's pig.
we're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
we got cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
why's your sister so mean to you dude?
this must be it. 
no, cartman, we're going in there and splicing fluffy and my elephant together.
yeah, quit being such a baby.
at least i'm not a little pigfucker!
what the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'd'!
there's no jews in san francisco, you retard!
i'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
oh, uh, i suppose so uh.  oh yes, over here.  here i have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here i have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.
diindoon - pig and elephant dna just won't splice!  although, maybe i could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.
watch out stan!  genetic engineers are crazy. 
naw, it's pretty fresh.
'ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  lunchy munchies, hmmm?
well, my father's family name being pirrip, and my christian name being phillip, my infant tongue…
righto. 
oh my god! they cloned a foot. 
forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. if you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
i don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
yeah stan, she's just a girl.
cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
try it.  we'll see you in a while, we got to go get cartman's pig.
come on kenny.
sick!
couple of days?  but terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
mom and dad are home.  my house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
you can't just leave me here alone.
does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
hmmm. you boys get first prize.
oh no. 
eric dear? i just got a call from your friend kyle's mother. she said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
ow! what the hell was that for?!
well i didn't have her do it. she did it on her own.
children! children! a certain student's mother called me last night.
pay attention children!  i'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch terrance & phillip any more, ever.
wow!
(oh my god!)  (owww!) 
yeah...
well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
well then, have one of your little friends do it. you can kill me can't ya?
ohh, is that a fact? well, let me tell you something, porky. your mom was over here earlier, and i humped her like a little bitch.
and then, i dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.
come on cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
i ever tell you about the time i boofed your dad, fatso?

trick-or-treat. 
oh, sorry children. i thought you were one of them.
damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
if everyone is turned into zombies...
the doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. now, i've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
yeah, i'm scared.
see cartman, your mom is on the cover.
we told you dude.
piiink eye!

children, children! to honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  yes, eric?
exactly.
i don't know eric, they just do.  now children, i want each of you to bring in one can of food. and later, the mayor of south park will divide it up amongst kenny's family and other poor people.
don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
this is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
many would rather die than go to those places!
did it come? did it come? is it here yet?
the digital sports watch is here.
i think he said his name is marvin.
nice to meet you starvin' marvin.
yes hon?
sure, hon.
come on starvin' marvin, i want you to meet my little brother.
okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. starvin' marvin can stay here for a week, then at stan's, then with me.
totally. 
this is a great way for you to experience america starvin' marvin. this is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
ap-ee-tizer.
this is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
yeah, yeah, we do!
he can do really cool stuff with his voice. show 'em starvin' marvin. 
this sucks, starvin' marvin is our friend.
you better watch what you say cartman! you might be poor and hungry some day.
hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving african child who was accidentally sent here instead of a teiko sports watch.
here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.
hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. these children desperately need your support.
so please, call and adopt a child today.
sweet.
oh, all right. listen up everybody, and listen good. go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. we'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. hurry!  we are not going to let our thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
sorry kid, but we're out of food. we ran out of funding. 
we just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.
sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. here, have a teiko sports watch.

who the hell are you?!
nooho, this is my cake!

okay, children, i'm really having a hard time with our christmas play.  the new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with jesus or santa claus.
so does anybody know  any non-santa or non-jesus christmas songs.  yes, eric?
i told you not to call my mom a bitch, cartman!
mr. hankey.
golly, that isn't very nice.  i'd sure like to teach him a lesson.

i wish kyle was here.  it just doesn't seem right without him.
what? why?
howdy-ho, mr. hankey!
well, i've got a loong night ahead of me.  bye-bye and merry christmas 
yeah... you know, it seems like something's still not right. 
happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...
what is this, cartman?
oh, sweet! your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
kick ass, dude! cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
yeah. if my mom could cook like cartman's mom, i'd be a big fatass, too.
oh, eric. i didn't get an invitation.
children, children! today is a very special day.
i'm not talking about your birthday, eric. we have a new student joining our class today.
wow, we have royalty in our class. why don't you take your seat, damien? we're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the baroque era.  now, children, nancy sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
here begins the rule of pain! the new domination of...
damn, what a freak!
damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? 
yeah. mine says 'red mega man'.
yeah, that's weak!
up yours. cartman. i'll get you whatever the hell i want. 
oh great, green mega man it is.

i don't know what to do, dude. do we go to the fight, or cartman's birthday?
we can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between good and evil!
well, come on. we we have to at least see the weigh-in.
... what the hell do you mean if i win the fight?
damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
i a - pologize for ruining your playground. and turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. i was doing my father's bidding. i didn't have a choice. 
let's focus on the fight, can we please? i'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'he's mean. he's a dirty fighter. he's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' it's just getting old. let's just let everything be decided in the ring.
come on, kiddies. eat more.
okay, i want a good clean fight guys. no punches below the belt, holding, or miracles. 
hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, damien.
come on, you little wuss, fight! throw a punch!
it's a game, dude. it's really fun.
aaaaa!
they were all out of 'em dude!
aaaaaaaa!
whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!

shut up, cartman!
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.

where's your present, cartman?
okay, kids. we're gonna take a spelling test now.  but as an extra incentive i'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner. 
well, she did! and she has horrible, horrible gas, too! she says she can't control it!
oh cool.

hello there, children.
hey, yeah!

i can't wait for ms. ellen to see what a raging lesbian i am.
hi guys, what's up?
wow! 
oh, no, mr. garrison's back.
so how'd your date with ms. ellen go?
i think so.
wendy, there's nothing between me and stan!
down! down! everybody down!
cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
...and so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. we dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month.
okay, i tell you what. why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own indian arrowheads. 
oh! oh i think i found one! 
oh. i do believe i found it first.
oh dear.
what do you mean?
oh. by, weh. i suppose if i must.
well-uh i, i guess you win.

no way, fatty, it's mine!
how's it going, boys?
hm, let me see that.  why, this is anasazi writing! my god, this must be thousands of years old!
well, i was just digging around, and i was all like, 'dude, i found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and i was all like 'dude.'
you liar, cartman!
thanks tom. those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby.
i'm going to put it in my room, where cartman can't find it.
you did throw it away, cartman.
well, you might as well let it go.
what would we use a marble sack for?
i didn't steal anything.
good! 
whoa!
yyeeaahh.
you threw it away, cartman!
problemo? huh, there's no problemo, officer. i was just introducing myself to these charming little boys.
cartman?
what the hell are you doing?!
cookeh monter
alright, alright! if it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
if it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! here!  there. now, get out of my house! and i hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
man, the bus sure is late.
yes. you see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. i'm so glad you found it, because without it i was sure to die within hours.
but i'll die.
i want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. it's worth a lot of money to me.
yeah, and you should have seen her nose. it was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
enough!!  oh, haa-ha. anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, i'll take you up to my condo where i'll kill you - i i mean-uh, uh give you - moneyy - for the triangle.
wait. isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
eh. soon, the triangle of zinthar will be mine, and i will be the biggest, most famous person ever!
you fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! i'll teach you to meddle with my triangle! 
hey! don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
wheeere is the triangle of zinthar?!
maybe this will help jar your memory...
nooow do you remember?!
happiness with you is like happiness... 
aagh! for christ's sake, cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
oh no! no! she has joned the two triangles?
it's over. she's too strong for them, children. we'll have to leave town.
dude! robert smith of the cure!
can i have my walkie-talkie back now, please?
alright, i'll roshambo you for it. ready?
good-bye, robert smith!
well, at least i have this sweet walkie-talkie robert smith gave me.
dammit cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 
yeah.
in the backyard?
yes, eric, i would like some tea. thank you.
yes, please, eric. why are you so cool?
you are so strong and smart, eric. everybody likes you.
we like ya, eric. you are the coolest guy in the world. this is tremendous tea.
oh, hell yes!
yes, eric, you are strong and smart and true. everybody likes you very much.
i donnow, just keep rolling.
yes, please, eric. you are tough and handsome.
i think you're a big fat piece of crap.
meow.
meow.
how is your beefy roast, snookums?
sure, hon.
uh huuuh.
yyeess??  well, what's your question, hon?
oooooohh.
ooohh, hhmmm . wwell - yyou see, eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.
and sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 
and then i saw him. he was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass i'd ever seen in south park. his name... was chief running water.  i don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning i was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
oh i never saw him after that. ah-i wasn't really that interested in him.
i heard he still lives on the ute reservation just outside of town.
meow.
cartman? what the hell are you doing dresed up like an indian with a bear necklace?
what?? 
what are you talking about, cartman?!
he claims to be your kid.
who the hell are you?
your mother?
cartman? hohoho. oh boy, i was worried there for a second.  look, kid, i'm not your father.
kid, i hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we native americans refer to as, 'bear with wiiide canyon.'
she is, 'doe who cannot keep legs together.'
your mom's a slut 
ahah, i'm plastered! 
he's the last person i saw with your mom that night.
shhh! here comes cartman.
cartman?!
dude, i thought you said you were native american.
hello?
boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
get in here! 
take that wig off!  what's gotten into you?!
what?! noh! uh, did i?
ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
"of course not. here. you children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. then, you'll see why i can't be your dad.
when a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
the magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
and they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
oooooooooo and they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
and the man says ""i love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, i gotta go to the bathroom""
so you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
and you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
finally she comes back, and she says, ""baby, i'm gettin' hot!""
and that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of..."
and that's... who she was with last! mr. garrison!
here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
i think you are one of the coolest people in the world, eric. and you are not fat at all. 
naw, you're not fat.
mr. hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  another cosmo, please.
what the hell are you talking about, eric?
i am not gay!
wait, wait.  i know a way to find out. 
at my laboratory. we can do dna genetic testing. i'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.
yes, of course! i mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...
three thousand should cover it.
i'm gonna buy a walkman with my half.
how's it going, cartman?
dude. what the hell is wrong with you?
come on, what's the matter, cartman?
wow. we're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
uuuh, cartman. we know how you can get $3000.
yyeah. we have a videotape that's in the finals for america's stupidest home videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
and now, back to america's stupidest home videos-
"and now our second finalist, ""little boy has a tea party."" "
we're sure to win, cartman. then you get your dna money! 
dammit!
did you hear that, dude? we still get $3000. that's enough for you to do your dna test.
or is it the 1991 denver broncos? the answer is coming on an all-new south park, in just four weeks.
they look like groundhogs.
and now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
who shot mephesto? was it the school counselor? or was it ms. crabtree? or was it--
waait!  he's still breathin'! he's not dead.
we've got to get him to the hospital.
come on, children! 
who will they kill next? will it be jimbo? barbrady? the denver broncos?
man, it's really starting to snow.  i hope they don't close the roads.
maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, cartman.
really?
i'm sailing away
set an open course for the virgin sea...
come on, stan. hospitals aren't all that bad.
well, this is about all i can do for him.
sorry, son, it might be a while.
now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. i'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
hey, cartman.
i'm sailing ay...
oh, weak. 
whoa, this is a good movie!
yes, i'm afraid we're critically understaffed. unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.  metaphorically speaking, that is.
coming! 
duhuhude! you barfed into the incision!
suction! 
who is screwing with the lights? is it barbrady? or jimbo? or the 1991 denver broncos?
we must split up into two teams: team a, and team b. team a will consist of myself, stan, kyle, eric, chef, and nurse goodly. team b will consist of kenny.  now, listen closely, team b. your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. to do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.  meanwhile, team a will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. we will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until team b makes it through the sewage duct. by that time, team b- remember, that's you, kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. it will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.  once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. are there any questions?
good. head towards it. team a out.
no, he'll die!
he was very brave. he risked his life so that mephesto could live.
i'm glad that you could all come. i can finally reveal who the father of eric cartman is. but first, i want to thank kenny mccormick for sacrificing his life--
alright alright. the father of eric cartman is... say, did anybody see that terrance and phillip special last month? wasn't that just the funniest thing--
no no, not exactly. but she did have a penis.  the fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so mrs. cartman's dna match with eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance.
i'm sorry i never told you, eric.  i just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
well, that's that. thank you all for playing.
who is eric cartman's mother? is it mrs. crabtree? sheila broflovski? the mayor?
okay, children. each of you gets to choose two books from the booktastic bus.
wow, these books look cool!
i drive the booktastic bus, where magic begins. you see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. you can take a canoe down the amazon or go back in time to camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. just like magic. the magic of reading.
yeah, this is stupid! books aren't magical. 
now, children, i hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.  who should we have go first, mr. hat? let's see...
eric, why don't you go first?
what's the matter, eric? are you not prepared again?
no, i can't say that i have.
and i give you an f, eric. now sit down!
hooray!
hey, that's right. you can help me. under article 39, section 2 of police code, i'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
you boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 
sure, nightsticks for everybody!  you keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the chickenlover case.
that's quick thinking, deputy. let's get to stark's pond immediately!
uhh, yes, officer?
well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
wait a second. aren't you stan's little friend?
yeah. you're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
yeah, right. you'd better get back to school, little boy.  ow!
ow! hey, what the hell are you doing? you can't do that! ah-ow! ah-ow! ow!
five george is en route to 496 broad wasteland...
hi there, little lady.
well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. is $20 enough?
what? oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?
hey, wait a minute. you're just a kid!
ow! oo-uhow! ow! hey, man, what are you doing?! ow, stop it!
all units, all units. five-twelve at 635 avenue de los mexicanos; request assistance. 
we're fine, officer. 
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy bob, who i met last year.
what—what did you say?
shut up, bitch!
mom hit dad again! 
all units. all units. we have a 5-20 on the suspect. report to the south park petting zoo immediately!
grab him! 
you're welcome. and now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. i give you this hardback copy of atlas shrugged, by ayn rand.
cartman!
well, he is. it turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
no, no, that's not how you uphold the law! 
you've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
wow! i guess reading really does suck ass!
uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
no, it's his bris.
i don't know. but there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
man! that sucked, getting searched. 
why did they search us? that marijawana never even made it to us.
no.
don't you boys know what a bris is? they're going to circumcise him.
ahhh, bicycles?
no, not ham, you fat fuck!
that's right.
"a ""fireman""?"
yeah, dude! it's a jewish tradition! it's called a circumstision!
dude, i asked five different people. they said all jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
your mother's made gahekgafuga.
meaning we're going to circumcise him. 
i have to save my little brother! i have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  come on, ike!  cover me for a while. i'll find a place to hide him and come back.
there, what do you think?
i used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
anyways, i need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize ike is gone.  knock it off, asshole!
come on, dude. if it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
dude, you shouldn't have told them that. now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
ohhh, thanks.
and you! you should be ashamed of yourself! don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
naturally.
okay, kids? uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? drugs are bad. you see, i was at the bottom of the barrel. i was a wreck; why, i didn't even care about money. i was-i was wasting my life... 
you can't have your bris tomorrow, cartman, that's when i'm having mine.
m'kay.
uhh... excuse me a moment, gentlemen. i don't believe i know how to play dodgeball.
ow, my nose! you broke my nose!
oh-- noooo!
i heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
eewwww!
"kyle! that is enough! i've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. it's called ""conjoined twin myslexia""."
agggggghhhhhh!
dude, i don't get it. why are we playing dodgeball again?
you-you don't understand, children. if we can win state, we can play in the nationals in washington, d.c.!
i'd love to!
all right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go! 
you got just one more, pip. you get this kid, and we are state champions.
some hadka fish, some gafagga...
you can eat after the game. you children win this one, and you're national champions! then you can go on and play the chinese.
you'll be in the news all over the world. south park will finally have a sport that it's good at. ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
dude, what does that mean?
i have no idea, dude.
ohhh.
dude, it's the freak nurse!
yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. and also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
awww..!
oh. yeah, we sure were.
wow!
aawwww!
welcome to detention, m'kay? mr. garrison told me about your little joke. it's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.
you're here because you are inferior, m'kay? you are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
we've got to get him back, dude.
did you guys ever see that one brady bunch where the guy... 
come on! we've gotta make another one! 
okay. action! 
cut! cartman!
it's supposed to be a frog!
since when do frogs talk, cartman?
der, cartman!
okay. here we go. ready? are you ready, cartman?
action!
blulululuh. screw you guys.
'cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
come on, cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
"okay, when i yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared."
it's acting, cartman. you have to pretend you're really scared, then the mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? ready?
good. a-and action! 
dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
they deserve it for lying to us, dude.
and you kids! i didn't bring you on this show to be boring. somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at ned here.
you big piece of crap!
bring it on, you bitch! 
you bastards!
yeah! then she told us to throw a chair at ned!
i sent her away.
hey, cartman!
are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
come on, fatass! you shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
i know, but, it's really snowy today.
come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
aaaah- 
just keep your trap shut. i'll consult the manual. 
mm-... mm-it's a ways.
what?
well sure. don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother ike? now, that was scary.
i think we have to signal them somehow.
yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, cartman! and the visitors are sure to come!
come on cartman, fart!
fart, damn you!
whoa, look at that.
hey, it's happening again.  it's a ice cream truck. now do you believe this, cartman?
you can say that again.
nope.
dude, i think it's saturday now.
well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
the lava's comin' right for us!
jimminy hope, it's the real scuzzlebutt!
dude! he's making ice cream. 
okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be scuzzlebutt, because scuzzlebutt's nice.
don't be stupid, cartman. our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  let's have ice cream, everyone! 
beefcaake!
but the monster outside couldn't be mr. garrison, 'cause mr. garrison used a gun.
hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
ah-i'm sure. let's get a cup of coffee. 
yeah. there's got to be a way out of this.
what?
eeeeyyyy! 
you bastards!
yeah, dude! kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! how could he have died back then, too?
don't worry. everything's gonna work out. it always does.
me too, marcus. i've forgotten all about my cares in the world.
i hope my dad doesn't sing.
oh. as i said before, the father is somebody in this room. the father is... john elway. 
uh oh.
come on, son. i'll buy you some ice cream. 
wait a minute. i though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
hooray!
wait, wait wait wait. this doesn't make sense. this whole thing doesn't make any sense. i must be-
ah-are you okay, hon?
oh. well. would you like some beetles for breakfast? 
mmmm.
well, i have to spend my summer in summer school, because i can't be left alone. you see, my parents are dead.
cool! maybe we can do that to cartman's cat.
jesus, cartman!
the kind that fit in cartman's cat's ass.
man, it's hot out here.
come on, cartman, get on.
what the hell are you waiting for, cartman?
yeah. your fat ass isn't on the sled!
right. 
swimming lessons? dude, that is the lamest thing i've heard heard.
yeah, cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
whatever, dude.
yeah, the fat ass olympics.
but cartman, we're trying to--
uh, crap..!
okay kids, everyone in the pool!  come on, eric, we're gonna start now.
just jump in.
it's not gonna hurt ya, hon. just do it. 
there you go! now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us.
eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.
just do your side stroke.
that's doggie-paddle, eric. now come over here!
okay.  that's it! that's it, you can do it!
come on, eric!
how are your swimming lessons going, cartman?
i heard you won't even get in the deep end.
yeah, they need to shut it off.
we should do what we always do. ask chef for help.
dude, i think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
thank you, that is all. 
hooray! 
the snake's been destroyed.  the pool's open!
hey, chef!
hoohh, like independence day? that sucked ass, too.
no they're not! independent films are produced outside the hollywood system. they're movies about all the glitz and glamour of hollywood.
once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
eric, if you call wendy a bitch one more time, i'm sending you to the principal's office!
that's it eric, you-!
wow, look at this, johnson. traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. it's almost like we're a real city.
children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. now i'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these hollywood types, and make a mint!
"they're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. and i call them, ""fudge 'ems"" "
stan, i have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. would you like to come with me?
shut up, cartman!  sure, dude. i mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
"get 'em while they're hot! my all new cookies! ""i just went and fudged your momma!"""
it was him, dude. i told you, it was mr. hankey!
aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
yeah, pretty much.
maybe they should project the movies on cartman's ass. 
dude, now that'd be like imax. 
(cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
well?
hey, dude, these are good!
"hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? they're big and salty and brown
if you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em..."
what was that? 
oh uh- hello, children.
good. see you in school. 
yeah, we're the goonies, cartman. why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
gosh, look at yuh. you're all growin' up sho fasht.
yes.
well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
mmuh i take it you're part owner of this whole mr. hooey story, right?
i want you to do a big-money deal with me.
mm-we-hell, i can see that you're the real brains of the group. you don't really need those guys, do you?
it's going over really well. people are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
i'll always love you, mr. hankey.
we have contracts.  you try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. but thanks so much for the hard work.
serves you right, cartman! you're a sellout!
you're daaamn right.
i'd like to pay for one.
i don't know.
sometimes i forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
how would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend kenny's house tonight?
boys, you're going to sleep over at kenny's, and that's final.
well, all i can say is, he's better have nintendo.  well, here's kenny's house.
nothin'. uhco-uh, come on in, i was jus' makin' dinner. 
sshh! cartman!
whoa, dude! you've got herpes on your face, too!
throw your sleeping bags in kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
amen.
that one's mine, that one's mine!
what? i'm just askin' a question.  you know, your dad and i used to be best friends when we were teenagers. we would work together at pizza shack. but he got promoted and went off to community college and i didn't. and you know why? 'cause your dad's jewish!
now kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. you have to split that with your brother.
"hey! we don't say ""fuck"" at the table, you little asshole!"
(waa-choo!)
ey! 
cartman, what the hell is that?
dude, i think i just saw a rat!
(uh-huh.)
don't scratch it, hon.
no, hon.
here, i got you some calamine lotion. 
it'll make your itches go away. 
not too much, hon. it says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
practice makes perfect, bubbe.
no, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 
i'm back, hon. i got some more calamine lotion. 
just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. it has to last a while.
come on, dude. we've gotta get out of here. i don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at kenny's a couple of days ago?
yeah, dude. your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
it's some kind of parental conspiracy. our parents are trying to kill us or something.
huh?
this itches! give me some of that calamine lotion, cartman.
it's true. we were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
ooh, i have them somewhere else, boopiekins.
oh, phillip, i'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 
what's that, eric?
aawwww!
well, cheesy poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy cheesy poofs song. watch for our talent van as it goes around the country.
does your child have what it takes to be the next cheesy poofs anthem singer? 
we're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the cheesy poofs song better than anybody.
come on, eric. we're going to the planetarium.
no, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! now, come on! 
yes. perhaps someday i can get a bone-marrow transplant.  yes, little boy?
well i don't know. but anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. but first, i wanna show you how the plane'arium works.
"here we see the constellation called, ""the big dipper"". if i project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it,  a-hah , we see where this constellation gets its name. these stars over here form the constellation of taurus, the bull , while these stars form the constellation, ""roger ebert"" . and these two little stars over here form the constellation the crusades . now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of..."
that was great, tommy. tommy fritz from torrey pines! he could be our winner.
oh, and what's your name, little boy?
aaah! 
wow!
wait a minute. where is eric?
did what?
you snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
yeah, mine too.
like you really need it, hippo-ass!
nnno! nn-don't go back! nnno!
well, i guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
eric, where have you been?
where have you been, cartman?
whoa!
"ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a jello mold.
mouth is flapping, too."
does that mean you're gonna be on that cheesy poofs commercial?
very good, kyle.
don't pick your nose, hon.
don't be nervous. i'm sure you'll win.
i hope so, honey. then perhaps we can eat for a little while.
come on! perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs! 
hello, everybody.  now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
well, heric cartman, that certainly was... insane.
thank you.  don't pick your nose, hon.
well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is eric cartman.
that's odd.
okay. let's shoot the commercial. where's our cheesy poof talent?
oohh, you look great, hon. mommy's fat little piggy.

hello? the-uh marshes aren't in right now. please leave a message.
hello, you've reached the broflovskis. please, leave a message.
terrance and phillip will be right back after these announcements.
and now back to terrance and phillip.
well, let's begin, shall we?  and now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known! 
cartman! you saved us! 
can you imagine it, stan. a mind, emptied by that... thing.
don't pick your nose, hon.
sgt. stanley marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. his only chance of survival is to sneak past the bosnian guard who stands watch.  sgt. marsh knows it's now or never. he must make a run for it.  american base is only a few feet away.
yeah! you're dead!
no, you don't!
yeah, cartman, you suck! if you want to play americans vs. bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
hey yeah! that'd be sweet! we could totally ruin their lives! 
we're building a clubhouse.
it's not lame, it's sweet! after we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play truth or dare!
yeah, now beat it you guys. this clubhouse is private!
fine!
fine!
fine!
fine!
fine!
(well, why the fuck do i have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
(uh--)
how's the treehouse coming along, hon?
sorry, hon.
well, i don't know, eric. if you did that, then the floors would be bare.
well, all right.
(you suck ass and you suck dick!) 
that is enough! mr. hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and i don't wanna hear it! anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
better than yours, fat boy.
but i didn't write the note!
mmkay.
(uh huh)
(yeah!)
(well, why do i have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
i'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha.
well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.
oh well, i guess it beats living at home.
hello?
we're working on it.
no, you don't!  dude!
"so, i'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""make sure you're home before midnight!"""
"and i go, ""listen, bitch! i don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"""
"and she goes, ""yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"""
"so i go, ""fine! i won't come home!"""
"and then she goes, ""fine! don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap."
i'm sixteen. i should be able to do what i want when i want.  i don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what i can and cannot do!
yeah, it's my body. my mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. i should be able to do whatever i want with it.
eric, snookums! it's time for mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
oh hey, scott.
uh- we invited some people over. hope you don't mind.
hey, kid, give me some of those! 
what? that game's for kids.
oh boy, it's getting late. i'm gonna have to leave this party.
(huh?) 
yeah, look. they're even signed by terrance and phillip themselves. 
dude, that kicks ass!
five dollars for three balls.
don't worry, kid, it's easy. you just gotta put one ball through jennifer love hewitt's mouth. 
okay, we've got a player!
okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
you suck, cartman!
here, give me some money, cartman!  lend me money, fat boy!
okay, here! 
okay. we've got $15 between us. that means we get nine balls to throw.
dare you enter the chamber of farts?
sure. it's veery scary.
no. we can't, dude. we have to win the terrance and phillip dolls.
you'd better be right, dude.
so, the chamber of farts has another victim, eh? don't be afraid. there aren't any ghouls here, only farts! 
yeah. what the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
we can't. we're saving our money for the balls in jennifer love hewitt's mouth game.
yeah, this line is way too long!
would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the line ride? 
just three dollars.
you dumbass, cartman!
no, it's not cool!
how much do we have left, cartman?  how much do we have left, cartman?!
what?! you said we had plenty of money, cartman!
you son of a bitch! aaargh!
well, cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the terrance and phillip dolls!
well, sorry's not good enough! what are you gonna do about it?
(dude, these are my fucking food stamps! how am i going to eat without all these food stamps?)
you said buttbaby. 
wait a minute! i've got it! the bullriding contest. cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  think about it, dude: $5000. that's 1000 set of balls. that's 3000 balls! we'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! now, either you're getting on a bull or i'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
he really wants those dolls.
hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, cartman.
you've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. okay, cartman?
we'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. ready? go. 
damn it!  that wasn't ten seconds, cartman. you have to do better than that.
get back on, fatass! you have to practice!
what'd you say, cartman??
i think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
okay, cartman. you ready?
open the gate! 
that bull sucks! he's not even bucking or anything!
hoh, yeah. that's a good idea. 
hold on, cartman!
cartman. cartman, can you hear me?
what?!
you think?
he still thinks he's a vietnamese prostitute.
cool. 
huh?
go away, kid. you're grossing me out.
(all right! i know!)
there he is!
yeah, and then those terrance and phillip dolls will be ours!
oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction.  up next, no. 14, ming li!
let her go! 
wow, and this vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!  i guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what i mean. 
ming li! ming li! ming li!
and this brave little whore from the east has really put on a show for us today!  the winner of the bullriding contest: ming li!
how many ball does that get us?
we did it! you see, cartman? you won us the terrance and phillip dolls!
oh. good idea, phillip. let's look for treasuh.
oh, hey, cartman. how are you feeling?
really? what about?
oh-h. nowhere. 
bye, ming li. thanks again. 
oh! son of a bitch!
what the hell are you singing, cartman?
hello, children. ready for lunch?
eric, is there a problem?
"""stinky britches"" by alanis morissette?"
yeah.
hey, chef.
eric, where did you hear that song?
children, i wrote that song 20 years ago.
we’ll get my dad to be chef’s lawyer!
and so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the…day, johnnie cochran has appeared to defend capitalist records. the question now is, will cochran use his famous chewbacca defense?
that's what cochran used in the o. j. simpson trial.
o-kay, then.
yeah. ready, cartman?
sure. just please stop.
did i? janis joplin, the beatles, elton john... i got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
yeah, it's bigger than cartman's ass.
can i help you?
we're trying to raise money for our school chef.
i'm sorry, but i'm not a big candy bar fan.
yes, of course. i'll buy three crispy yum yums.
yeah. what the hell do you want?
he’s not dying, cartman!
cartman?
no more chef.
no! chef wouldn't give up on us. how many times has chef gotten us out of trouble?
hey, that's a great idea!
what? jail?
cartman just needs to put more into it. dance better, cartman!
we are raising money so that chef can hire johnnie cochran to sue you!
hey, that's your song for wendy!
he probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
what?
stop screwing around, dude. we're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
hey, cartman! did you bring us money from your mom?
you said you could get us money, cartman!
it's okay. kenny said he'd get one.
"why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!"
that's not cool!
who the hell could that be? 
(uh huh!)
(it's the only thing i could afford.)
i haven't been sleeping so well.
i don't know.  oh, great. he's got that stupid beard on again.
hoh, that sucks, dude.
cartman?
what are you doing?!
you can't be standing there, cartman.
because you're standing over there! 
wow, you don't see this every day.
it's like i'm looking in a mirror.
oh. well, uh, don't worry, stan. i'm sure it'll work out. now, what's the other problem?  oh, nohoho.  oh, dear god, no!
don't you see, children? this cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
dude, that's not cool. she's got parkinson's disease.
cartman!
that's it, dude. we've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
i'll help you, stan.
can do!
"i don't see any pet stores called ""indian burial ground."""
that fart was absolutely ghoulish, terrance. 
meow.

who's my kitty? who's my little kitty? my fluffy little cat. yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. 
aaaaagh!
aha! there you are, cartman!

hey! what's wrong with you, cartman?
come on, mr. wholesome! we're taking you back to our universe!
hall right! just stand there, cartman! this gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!
yes!
don't worry, evil cartman. you're staying with us! 
why don't you guys take our cartman back? he's more like you anyway.
noooooo! 
sorry cartman. we like evil cartman better. see ya. 
our cartman would never say anything like that.
you tricked us, cartman!
oh, it's my pleasure. eric loves his little friends.
okay, let's go!
see you in a couple of days, son.
yeah. or, we could not.
"over the meadow and through the woods,
to grandmother's house we go"
ooo, careful hon. these roads are bumpy.
wheat. the building block of your favorite foods, and, nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. you see, when nebraska first became--
i don't know. ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.

"the horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
through white and drifted snow..."
jesus christ, finally!

eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin elvin?
dude, is he here every year like this?
"god-damn it, why the hell do i always have to say grace? if one more person asks me to say grace, i'll be like, ""eh! i'm not saying grace! and if you ask me again, i'll kick you square  in the nuts!"""
no, jimmy, this is my pot pie!  no, jimmy! that's a bad jimmy!
i heard it, too.
i wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
i wanted to make sure, too.
dude, it's coming through the window! 
oh. hey, eric. i didn't think anybody'd be down here.
yeah, well i'b i busted out.

okay, chuck! thank you very much!
all families suck ass!
what's the matter?
do you really think we should go with this guy?
that's nice, kid. i knew mr. hankey before he was even famous.
mr. hankey kicks ass!
so?!
i really like that guy.
some kid must have said it wasn't the real mr. hankey again. 
uh, i went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone.  look!
run for your lives, boys! 
keep your heads down, kids! 
alrighty, then. 
i always do. see ya, eric. thanks for all your help.
yeah, we don't care.
sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
the underpants gnomes. the little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 
but we'll starve and die like dogs.
(fuck you!)
(look at me! look at me!)
killer!! 
eugh.
"""and as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam america..."
boys, you have really opened our eyes. we didn't even know this was happening.
come on, boys! let's go!
uh...
i like small businesses.
uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
so what are we gonna say?
waagh!
what the hell? 
hey there, little guy.
cartman!
why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
is that all you've got, pussy?
hey, he talks!
you're a pussy, pussy!
o-kay. follow me. 
not much longer now.
no, pussy, i'm taking you to my village.
follow me.
yeah. it's almost as big as cartman's ass.
this is where all our work is done.
you see,phase 1: collect underpants. phase 2: ... phase 3: profit.
just kidding, son. 
(he actually killed it!)
yeah! 
that's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
get away from me, cartman! 
(you bastard!)
why the hell not?! that's like calling the sky blue!
i think so. is cartman up there?
cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
damn it, i guess i'll have to go get him.
sorry.  what the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
he's like, some frozen guy.
you guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! send some more rope!
help me chip some of the ice away.
cartman, will you shut the hell up and get some more rope?!
hooray!
(well, i think you guys should name it steve)
we came for our reward.
no, i'll go! i found him!
guess what? you're not my best friend anymore! cartman's my new best friend!
oh yeah? well you're not my best friend anymore, either! cartman is now my best friend!
fine! 
well, i was talking to cartman, too!
i'm sorry, too. i'll leave you alone.  eight and thirteen? 
damnit, cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight kyle, not playing australian outback guy!
you suck as a best friend, cartman!
come on! 
was the ice man here?
sure i can! i can hunt down anything!
wait a second.  i think he came through here recently.
calm down, calm down.
yeah.
yes, hello. i see you.
no- dude, gorak is cool because it's original. and besides, you found him.
me, too. he sucks.
moo! 
"eric cartman, you say ""excuse me""!"
so, who wants to join the fun??
excuse me?
well, uh, that's all, really.  so, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, i'll leave information packets up front.
and that's exactly why you need to go!
did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
okay, children, that's all of us. we're ready to head for the latin american nation of costa rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
and you must be eric cartman. i've heard about you. you don't respect nature or other cultures.
now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
oh, look, children! i think we're entering san josé, which is the capital of costa rica.  oh! this is so exciting!
eric, costa rica is a third-world country. these people are much poorer than those in the u.s.
eric, sit down!
your family isn't poor? 
yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
kids, this is the costa rican capitol building. this is where all the leaders of the costa rican government make their-
all right, that does it!  eric cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
you may think that making fun of third-world countries is funny, but let me-
eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the costa rican president?
because i'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
thanks!
the rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.
wow! isn't he neat, lenny? 
eric, what the heck are you doing?? 
and here is a three-toed sloth. 
eric, for god's sake, knock it off!!
the yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. soon, they will have nowhere to go. so we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
what's the matter, little boy?
oh my god!! 
oh, no! god, no, no!  don't panic, children.
¿qué?
i don't wanna burrito, i want a taco. supreme.
i want two tostadas and mild sauce.
oh, there's just no end to this place! i think maybe we're going in circles. oh, dear god! the summit starts in an hour; i'm gonna lose my job!  aaaah!
eric, where are you going?
young man, i am the adult here, and i say you go this way!
young man, i have had it!!
good! you deserve to die, you little bastard!  eric, we have to stay together!
no. the spirit of maya has told me to go this way.
what are you doing here, little boy?
lost in the rainforest? oh, my lord! where are all the others?
oh my god! get this child some food, quick!
chicken wings!
eric?
(well, see you guys. i gotta go take the bus out of town.)
(yeah, you guys. seriously.)
you bastards!
this is gonna be fun.
you're too fat to be jesus!
stan should be jesus.
you're such a fat baby!
all right, all right, you could be jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
die! 
station two: jesus takes his cross.
and then jesus' disciple, peter, denies he knows him. 
i don't know you, dude.
station eleven: jesus is nailed to the cross. 
"then a crown of thorns was placed on jesus's head, and jesus was all like, ""thanks."""
and then jesus was lead away  to mount sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
hey, that went really well. they really liked it.
aw man, at least the real jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
okay, cool. see you, cartman.
yeah, me too.
cartman, how stupid are you?! didn't you read the bible? we have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
then i can give it to my dad. 
now we just gotta wait for his urection, and i can give it to my dad.
cartman??
how come you're not dead yet, cartman?!
look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like jesus.
yeah. so hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
yeah.
nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
t. t is for turtle.  nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
dude, he's still not dead.
she's not worried about you.
that's not your mom calling!
how stupid do you think we are?! now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before i kick your ass!
hey, yeah! 
don't worry, mayor. i'll find the cause. or else. or else what? exactly. 
what the-?  oh, what now?!
children, what the hell are you doin'?
you children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
eric, i have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
it's really gonna piss you off.
this is just a dream. you're still up on that cross.
really? great! i don't have to worry about that anymore. 
that's amazing!
dude! you're still alive, cartman?
dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
yes. and when i get down from here, i'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
you have to see the eye doctor, eric.
you're not fat, you're big-boned.
eric cartman. 
hello, eric.
how's my little piggy today?
i just say that because you're my little buddy.
hop up on the chair.  don't break it now!
just kidding. let's see how your eyes are doing.  all you have to do is read the letters. can you see the letters?
all right, read them out for me.
"no no. that, that was just a weird coincidence.  i do not know how that happened.  ""i am a little piggy."" wow! what are the odds of that?  all right, let's get down to business, shall we? "
hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? one, or two?
just pick one. or two.
okay. one, or two? one, or two?
one, or two? one, or two?
no! the answer is one, piggy! one! 
yeah.  oh, here he comes.
whoa, what happened to your eyes, cartman? 
why?
why do you have to see an eye doctor?
dude, just ask chef for help. he always knows what to do.
hello there, children.
sure gang! i have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. derp!
yeah, we gotta talk to chef after school and get him to come back.
shut up, cartman!
what's the problem?
he didn't even seem like chef. he seemed like a empty shell of a man.
...yeah, screw that bitch.
all right, we got the test results back, piggy-
you've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
it means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
well, don't worry. i've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. 
i know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
that's why we have the little stapler. 
they said that chef works in one of these buildings 
dude! just take them off!
third cubicle on the left  hey! aren't you that cute little kid from jerry maguire?
wow! you really got fat.
no way, dude!
that's easy! get some laser corrective surgery. that's what i did.
hello, children!
there you are, eric! come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
come on. do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
now, hon.
okay, let's get started. you're here for the liposuction, right? 
all right. time to laser me a little piggy. 
cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
damn, your eyes must really suck, cartman.
eric, you have a little visitor. is that all right? 
hello, boys. i heard eric had laser surgery, so i made him a pie.
jesus dude! 
oh man! there's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
dude! chef's wedding is in three hours. we've got that much time to find out how to destroy a succubus.
hey yeah! what's that song she always sings? there's got to be a morning after.
he's asleep. wake up fatass!
god-damnit! you can't fall asleep.
all right. kyle and i are gonna take our positions up front.
cartman!! wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
-the to on- 
come on cartman!
oh my-
hooray! 
oh, hello, piggy. how are your eyes doing?
i don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
was he an organ donor?
wrong! you are here because you are america's future!  you may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.
arrrrh!
yes, you did!
(woohooo!) 
hey! don't screw around! you screw around too much!
no he's not dude. craig is a wuss.
do you wanna bet?
how much?
rrrrh! he doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
he did?
why would he say that?
well, i've gotta go over there and-
this is gonna be so sweet, dude.
we'll see!
you're on, fatass! 
aw, hell!
okay.
red racer's on.
i do watch red racer every day of the week!
nope. 
what?! what did he say about stripe?!
that son of a bitch, i'll kill him!
after red racer.
i uh...
he'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
shut up, fatass!!
dump that zero and get yourself a hero! he could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. 
that's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
well?
huh?
aw, dude, come on!!
all right. tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and cartman, you teach craig.
oh yeah? well, i'm gonna have my uncle jimbo teach tweek how to box!

the object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. is opponent ready?
let us begin.  ready? and, th-ree.
body rike a stone! mind rike a meatroaf!
this ass is unlike any i've encountered, master. 
there is indeed great power in your ass, eric. perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.
rrrr, mean, rrrr.
okay.
come on, tweek!
ye-hah!
go, tweek. kick his ass! get him!
well, why the hell don't you stop them?
yeah. see, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. we made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
what was on the news?
come on, tweek! you got him!
give him sucky, craig, give him sucky! hurlong churshar!
where are you going?
just go behind a tree.
so? you can poo in the wilderness.
cartman, don't be such a baby! we're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
not here! go further away!
watch out for ground eels! 
what do you have to think about?
sick, dude!
(here you go.)  (no way!) 
oohma poota!
we don't wanna look at it, cartman!
no way, dude!
i see it!
over here!
meesa gonna die? wooo-wowoop!
well, let's kill it.
huh?
do you realize what this means? we could use its dna and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
it's got a dragon painted on the blade. this is the sumatomi sword-
i'll think about it, hon.
mommy's busy, boopie-kins.
go ahead, snookums. it's probably one of your little friends.
hmmm. 
please help me. whoa-oh-oh-oh.  please help me find junjun. she has been gone since last night, and i'm worried sick.
what means a jakovasaur?
oh. cool beans.
that's 'cause junjun's a girl. girls talk different.
please take me to junjun. we're the last of our kind. there are only two of us left.
did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
who's that? one of your mom's boyfriends?
wow!
huhello, guys. i love new friends. 
what are we supposed to do with him?
why don't we just tell our parents?
i am whispering!  yyeow!
thank you, mayor.  the noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. and now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back.
what are you doing, fatass?!
and now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, eric cartman!
yeah. 
dude, i don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
maybe their baby will be still-born, like cartman was. 
well. ap-parently, they breed in litters.
dude, this sucks ass!
hooray! 
great, eric! we're moving.
me, jun and the family are heading to the promised land of memphis.
yeah. let's get that luggage packed!
it would?
o-kay. i like south park best of all. we're staying!
you can't leave.
little boy, we're making you an honorary department of interior person.  so now, you are officially in charge of south park's fish and wildlife. you have authority over all of them.
that's right. and people must respect it.
fine, just fine.
you're a nut! let me see that letter.  it's from a game show. the mayor has invited me to compete. 
eric! the mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in south park! big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-
sorry, folks, a little mix-up. we're playing best out of three!
we just have to show you this new species because you're the department of interior guy now. soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
there it is!  that must be of the antelope family.
cartman, jakovasaurs are making south park suck. you have to understand that.
werrr. 
close the door! 
eric, this is for the best.
hi, eric! okay, bye, then! 
eric, it's important for you to understand-.
hooray!
now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  yes, eric?
ohh, dude, get me out of here!
you would think that, you little ass-sucker.
an ass-sucker. it means you suck ass. you see an ass, you suck it. you're an ass-sucker.
what?
no you can't, you little ass-sucker!
this is cartman vs. marsh, case no. 3433. what is your complaint, mr. cartman?
all right. let's move this along, shall we? now, eric cartman, uh, you claim that stan marsh sexually harassed you in school.
hoh, whatever! 
i called you an ass-sucker!
all right, we did it!
i have to give him half my stuff?
sweet..!
yeah, dude. that's my favorite toy.
uh, no! i hate that toy!
hm.  you know, eric, i've been thinking, uh...
uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  perhaps we should sue them next.
well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. and, they have a lot more money. i think we could get a lot more out of this than half of stan's belongings.
all right! we did it, eric!
you see, cartman? you see what this has done?
eric cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed pip philip at school.
i won!
well, they're about to get worse. all i can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
sorry, children. all my funding's been cut.
well, i hope you do. otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
oh! well, uh... we had to let him go.
dude, what the hell is going in?!
kids, there was a panda bear in here. he said somethin' about the island of misfit mascots.
"oink oink! be sure to run around with scissors, says oinky, the ""run around with scissors"" pig."
okay, sorry, sorry.
oh, save me! who will save me?
if we save her, i am going to take off her pants and play slip'n'slide!
you cannot stop me, james west!
eric.  the babysitter's here. come on downstairs.
i have to leave soon, eric.

"...so i said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w-"
...but when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! the one night-

"okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. okay, ready? all right, let's try the new song. this is a song i wrote for you, shelly. 
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

"bridge!

gotcha! 
i don't care.  he acted like he really liked me. nobody's ever liked me before.  i can't believe i trusted him. i'm so stupid.
nobody my age would go out with me 'cause i'm too ugly.
you don't think so?
you're right! he is a scumbag! i wish i could get him back! i just don't know how.
huh?

salma hayek? whoa, she's hot.

they're having a cat orgy!
your mom's gonna get home soon. we're gonna get busted!
come on! we've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  you know, eric. it's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
hi, kids. i'm home.
wow, she passed out.
well, let's clean up the house. looks like everything turned out o-kay.
that's how it goes in the wild wild west.

i hope you give them the chair!  anyway, children, as i was saying, hare krishnas are totally gay. 
relax, fatass.
what??
ow, dude! 
approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over chinese air space.
cool? that craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! do you think that's cool?!
alright, children, we just need to know one thing: do you know this person? 
you dumbass, cartman! now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
we already know you know him. we have this!  now, who is he?! 
who is this person!
aaaaaaaa!
adopted from whom?
god job, fatass!
come on, dude. there's gotta be somethin' about starvin' marvin in the news.
uh, god wants you to send us money. he needs you to send us money so we can help others.
whoa! 
he did take a ship.
this is great!
blubedegub? 
dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
cool!
screw you, cartman! i called leader first!
alien race? have they... heard the word of christ?
get 'em! 
kenny!
(you guys, just fly away!)
which button did you press, cartman??
you dumbass, cartman!
i have the infidels in my sight. 
ho ho ho ho.
sorry, marvin. we tried.
wo?
dama doko nou na oh. 
oh, foada! 
now's our chance!
alright!
maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
dude!
i know, but you don't tell him that!
uh-hall right! well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.
of course, dumbass, it's halloween.
christmas?
awwww! 
those things are stupid, cartman. they just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
welcome to spooky laboratory.  i'm your guide, dr. spookalot. allow me to show around the lab. 
here i have a bowl of human eyeballs.
and here you can feel the brains.
and here you can feel the warm innards of the body 
ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha!  just wait till tomorrow! we're gonna scare you kids to death! ha ha ha haa! 
come on, you guys, think! how can we scare the fifth graders? it has to be something reeaally scary.
aaaaah! 
eric, your little friends are here.
e-heric, it's only halloween.
come on, fatass, we have to go!
i'm sorry, hon,
yes you can, porky. 
he must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
god-damnit, mom!
okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
what's the scariest thing we could get?
yeah, fatass, a dead body.
yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
are you insane?!
relax, dude. what's the big deal? think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
this is gonna be fun!
i don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
yes you do! now, dig! 
aaaah!
eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
okay, grab the sled. 
how exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
cartman?!
(mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
package delivery for mrs. cartman?
sign heah, and heah, and heah. 
where's kenny? he said he had the best halloween costume ever. 
where's your costume, fatass?
(hey, guys. uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
alright. the fifth graders are gonna be here soon. let's get kyle's grandma!  this is gonna be sweet
what's the problem?
no grandma??
what does this dead grandma look like?
good idea.
we need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. i know, your antonio banderas love doll.
okay. here's how the trap will work. when the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for antonio banderas.  when they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.
alright! great job, gang! 
sweet! 
eric, mommy got you a present!
nnno, i got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
"this year is gonna be different. look!  i got you ""hooked on monkey fonics."" "
"welcome to ""hooked on monkey fonics,"" level 1. i will read the sounds and the monkey will help keep the beat.  if your monkey arrived in the box dead, call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey. ready? let's begin. the learning monkey is here to saythat reading is easy and it's okay.work with the monkey and you will learnto spell hard words, like ""morbid"" and ""burn.""start with card 1.  ready? begin!  c, h.  chalk. "
good. card 2.  t, h.  there.

shut up, fatass! everyone knows i can spell better than you.
what?! 
"our first contestant is mark cotswolds, from home school.  all right, mark. your word is ""conscientious."""
"""conscientious."" c o n s c i e n t i o u s."
okay, our next contestant is eric cartman.  alright, eric, here's your word: chair. chaaiirr. 
"eric, your word is ""chair."""
something you sit on.
english! 
"oh, for christ's sake, kid! the word is ""chair""!!"
damn, dude. those home-schooled kids are smart.
it was nice competing against you boys. we will have to do it again sometime.
no. i live right over there.  i've lived there all my life.
my parent teach me. so i stay at home instead of going to school.
right.
shut up, cartman?
you shut up,  gaywad!
hey, guys. what's up?
alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. now, who can tell me when columbus sailed the seas and discovered america?  ehyes, mark?
the answer is 1492. however, the americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the vikings and the native americans. and therefore, your question is a charade.
now, who can tell me what country columbus was from?  put your hand down, creampuff.
you don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
yeah. i wonder how cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
welcome to huntin' and killin' with jimbo and ned.
hon, are you ready for some math problems?
oh, all right. 
yes?
sure, hon. 
oh, i'm sure father will give me a ride. 
eric, i got you a new history textbook. why don't you come downstairs.
eric, please. we have to do some studying today.
hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
well, get your ass out of bed!  we have to go deal with that home-school kid!
but the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
(hey!)  (hey, cartman, help me.)
oh my god, fonics monkey killed kenny!
thanks, gaywad. 
ready? 1-2-3-4. 
cartman, what the hell are you doing?
well, you have to hit it softer!
you're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
that's it, cartman, you can't be the drummer!
dude, the civil war reenactment is tomorrow! you're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
alright alright. let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
cartman!!! 
give me the drum, and you play the flute.
cartman, i'm the leader of the reenactment fife and drum squad, and i say you play the flute!
you dick!
dude, that's not cool.
yeah! you're dressed up like the south.
you can't just come to a civil war reenactment dressed up like general lee, fatass!
the south loses this battle, cartman. they lose the war!
no they're not, stupid!
come on, cartman! how much do you wanna bet the south doesn't win?!
and if the north wins you're our slave for a month??
you're on!
hey! what's that guy doing?!
the confederacy doesn't take the bell!
alrighty everyone.  we're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. now, i know you're just trying to help eric, but we have to let the union capture the bell this time.
wuh. well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.
what??
run for your life, dude! 
aw, come on. have a little sip. 
yeah. too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
you're dreaming!
huh?
they don't?!
i'll bet we could, too! 
what?!  is that a challenge?! i'll bet we can!
yeah! 
they're just drunk, cartman! as soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
this is the most bizarre thing i've ever seen.
uh topeka. we're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  eh, it's probably the most fun i've had in several months. wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
i know! but we'll have to wait until dark.
where to next, general?
well, i guess uh fort sumter in south carolina. that's where the civil war really escalated.
welluh, that sounds great. i'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. you want anything?
well, come on everybody. we've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
we're goin' home kid. come on. 
uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
haha! you lose, fatass!
where are you going?
me neither.
i got you. oo-oh. 
woohoo!
yes.  imagine what it must have been like: you're a union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of confederates ready to pounce on you.  uh...
give up, fatass! there's over a hundred national guards down here.
what do we do, general? we're outnumbered.
wow, look at that! the entire state of south carolina showed up! 
yee-haw! all right!
mr. president! a message for you from the extremists! 
boy, we really got the president by the balls. good thing you have that videotape of him and marisa tomei.
boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?
men, i want you all to know that as president of the confederacy, i am hereby surrendering.
hey, come on. we should take a tour of the smithsonian before we head back.
lincoln and davis signed the treaty, general. the war is over.
yeah. and now you can take that stupid beard off! 
well cartman, the south lost! that mean you're our slave for a month!
now, the first thing i want you to do for us is-
what??
awwww!
"okay, ike. you're my little brother, so i have to show you how to celebrate hanukkah.  this is called a dreidel. you spin it and see where it lands. and you sing this song:
i have a little dreidel; i made it out of clay.
and when it's dry and ready, with dreidel i shall play. oh,
dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, i made you out of clay.
dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel i shall play."
oh! hey cartman. we're playing dreidel; you wanna try?

dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
i made you out of clay.
dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
with dreidel i shall play.
what's going on? ...oh, it's that hanukkah thing.
i'll try
to make it spin.
it fell;
i'll try again.
i'll try
to make it spin.
it fell;
i'll try again.
oh, how precious! you boys are all playing dreidel. now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the hebrew people.
"now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
you'll know our people always win.
keep spinning:

to make the dreidel spin 
you'll know 
our people always win.

yeah!  i was just hanging out in my room, and then i perioded all over the place.
awesome! we get powers?
"he gives me hope when
i have only been bored
and he lifts me up with
his gentle arm..."
here.
(dammit, here!)
(yes, i agree. i think craig is a thousand times as cool as clyde. there doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
oh. ah-ah. ah-uh-m-m.
nothing. um , my period is really uuuh...  uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
my pleasure. i just love helping people.
hey assholes! 
dude, i don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
so what are we gonna do for new year's?
aaaargh. i'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
(ooooowwwwwwwhh.) 
(oh- ooowww!)
who-o-oa, du-ude. i've got boobs.

no. i didn't, but-
"now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and i wanna make sure south park is the best! okay?!  recorders up.  and a-1 and a-2 and a-  ""...of liberty."" you're late!  ""...my father-"" what the hell was that?!  god-damnit, i don't think you children have been working on your fingering!"
shut up, fatass!
don't look at me! uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
m'kay.
(uh-uh.)
(nope.)
cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"what's ""lose bowel control?"""
oh, brother, here we go again. cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
nuh-uh!
there is no brown noise, fat boy!
oh yeah? well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! 
oh, brother! you guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
oh yeah? well, what is it, then?!
damnit! 
what's it mean?! what's it mean?!
damnit cartman, wha-?!
no, uhno, not finkleroy.
okay, children. we need to play closer attention to the sheet music. remember, if you get lost, just follow along with mr. kenny g here.
yeah. they think they're so cool.
you found what?
i don't believe it!
that's amazing.
dude, are you thinking what i'm thinking?
no! that we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole new yorker kids.
yeah, dude!
how do we write he note, cartman?
alright. now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note cartman played.  come on.  there.  that should do it.
oh no, dude. look!  it's the music we changed! 
yeah, we was wrong about you guys. we're sorry.
that's not fair! cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
sleds are for guys.
yeah!
yeah! and with cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
fatass.
oh! 
eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
don't apologize to us, apologize to him!
well, i hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, eric.
not this time, eric! you've got to learn to respect your little friends! you're gonna have detention for two weeks!
i'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, mr. school counselor.you see, since the victim in this case is african-american, this is considered  a hate crime.
new laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.
oh no.
"mr. cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""token?"""
who is token?
black!  did you say black?! you called him black?!
o! he said it again!  he is african-american, and so you decided to pick him out!
the rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate african-americans!!
what?!
"ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! this ""monster"" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!"
eric cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. for this, i hereby sentence you to the alamosa juvenile hall, until you turn twenty-one.
alright, you! ...uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? 
(what the fuck for?!)
(mexico?! why the heck do i have to take you all the way to mexico?!)
(hey!)
(yes)
tom, it looks like the go-go action bronco is heading east on 285. police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway.  tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. he's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.
don't worry, dude. that little truck just runs on d batteries. it's gonna run out of juice soon. 
prisoner 24601, arriving.  forward, prisoner! you will wake up each morning at 0500.  lockdown is until 0900. at ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  at 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. your cellmate is romper stomper! 
yeah!
oh yeah? the way i see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like animaniacs, and kids who don't like animaniacs. you're either with us, or you're against us. so which are you?!
...neither do we
yeah!
here you go, boys. keep it short.
hey, fatass. how's prison?
yeah! so you gotta bust out of here.  so we made you this cake.  there's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
an ailnay ilefay.
yeah, you stupid umbassday!
...yeah.
well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. each year, over a million people die of smo-
sshh! 
how are we supposed to give them to you?
but they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
alright, here. 
me too.
don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
well, did you get the cigarettes?
alright. go sit on the toilet and poop them out. i'll keep an eye out for the guards. 
you flushed them?!
no way, douche. i told you: i ain't your friend. if you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
sit down, boys. i'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. 
cool! my very own tic-tac-throw game.  ew, it smells, man.
you're not gonna break out of here! you're here 'til you're 21, douche!
i just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. what? you actually think i give a crap about you?
hneah. you'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  hey guys! i gots me a new tic-tac-throw  yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! you can play it at recess.  hey. uh, what are you doing?  you... you can't cry in prison, man. they'll bust your head open. what's the matter with you?!
dude. 
look, if it's that important to you, i'll bust you out of here.
hurry up! they're sending the dogs after us!  mph. oowww!
it's my leg! i think it's broken.  you go on ahead without me.
"hey.  you're supposed to say, ""i'm not going without you,"" or something."
look, kid, you go on. you've got something to live out there. you've got friends.
i sure would have liked to have seen disneyland. here. i want you to have these. 
"no! you're supposed to say, ""i can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!"
take them. they'll bring you luck.  now go on. get out of here. 
yeah?
alright, freeze! 
but you've been pardoned by the governor! 
huh-okay. uh-ready, uhset,-
hooray!
oh, thank you! thank you for coming back!  thank you so much. thank you.
okay. everybody ready? on your marks.
uh-get set. go! 
go, fatass!
we're not gonna make it! 
yeah,. we're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
let's all hear it for cartman's big, fat ass!  oh-ff. 
naah.
eric!
wow! i've never had a visitor before!
you did? 
yeah. 
whoa! 
oh, yeah!
oh, the monorail!
what is it, snookums?
oh my! she must think that you are a very special little muffin.
"don't say ""tits,"" eric."
well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
but eric, i think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? you're not the tooth fairy! i'll see you later!  aw, man, this is so tits!
he's fat and he's stupid?
for one tooth?
i only got a jar of gefilte fish.
...totally what?
sega dreamcast??
(no way!)
(no i don't! thank you.)
(why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
(woohoo!)
(hey, guys!)  (heey-ungh)  (oowww.)
hu-aah!
jesus christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
what the-?  who's there? who is that?!
hoh. sorry, miss fairy. i didn't mean to gaze at you. i'm back to sleep now, see? 
well, oh gosh, i, i didn't think you'd be so fat.
come on, fatass!
well?
tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
no, honey, mommy's gotta save her throat. i have to work tonight.
good night.  what do you have there, eric?
oh, my. the tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
i know, huh?
did the tooth fairy come?
(oh, my god!)
what?
yes, eric
oh. eric, poopie, sit down.  mommy has something to tell you. it's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, eric. i've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, i've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
i'm sorry, eric. all children find out sooner or later.
no, honey. it's just-
oh, eric, it's just part of being a child.
eric! eric, wait!
dude, where's the money?
what are you talking about, cartman?! we're only $167 away from gettin' a sega!
cartman, what's going on?!
tell us what?!
"what do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"""
that can't be. my parents wouldn't lie to me.
you're wrong. if my dad says something is real, then it's real!
fun for children?! fun for children?! look at me, dad! i don't even know what's real anymore! weaaaah! 
what about dan rather? do you think he's real?
you guys! you guys! i figured it out!
yeah, but, it's okay! we can still get our sega dreamcast!
the kid will never even know.
we can take the bus to the city. there's super-rich people down there!
what if this is all just somebody's dream?
"totally, dude. cherry creek is the richest part of denver. i'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""tooth fairy."""
there. you can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got mega man stickers on it. cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. we'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
this is the smartest business venture ever. 
because that's what we're doing!
nice tooth fairy costume. you think anybody'd believe you in that?!
right on our turf, boss! i ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  erp.
amazing.
it's that, or else i can cut off your penises. 
i'll cut you in at 2%.
oh. well, uh, i'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
oh my god! there has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
dude, having this much money is great! working for loogie rules!
we can't do that, dude. loogie will kick our asses.
dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
i am going to find out who the boss is! and when i do i'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! 
that's right, yeah  . it's all top-grade stuff, too.these chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?
well, huh, tang li wants 30, but, but i can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? 
awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.
huh?
this is your last chance, kid! either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
naw, come on. d'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
dude, this book says i don't exist unless i think i do. but what if i don't?
duuuh, which button do i hit again, boss?  just kidding. you know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? i was, you know i was actin', i was actin' like him, eheh, oh.
well, i can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? kolovski , put this buttwipe out of his misery. 
what the hell?
i can't believe i fell for such an obvious trap! what the hell is wrong with me?!
yeah. but you know, i've learned something today. you see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. what we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. but our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
where?  oh, no.  ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  no, thank you.  go away, please.
you didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, stanley? 
ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during sarque du son bleu
(woohoo!) 
those contorting romanian chicks rule.
cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! they're identical!
damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
(hunh?)
hurry up, you guys!
hello.
(hey!)
what are we going to do now? 
how can you say that?
hooray!
you don't wanna go back to stinky romania, do you? it sucks there.
we'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 
no! we've just gotta convince these chicks that america kicks the ass out of every other country. come on! 
yeah. woo hoohoohoo. yeah. 
oh, randy, it's gone! it's all gone!
yeah! well, not this time!
i'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. 
look at you, father. you walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! you are a liar and a fake!
and you romanian leaders , you don't care about us! all you care about is making america look stupid!
and you protesters! don't you have anything better to do?! get a life!
oh, well. doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
okay, children, i hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. first of all, who can tell me what year the founding fathers got together?  let's see, how about...
wendy?
good job, wendy. and what was that document called?
kyle?
hey wait. i think maybe i have attention diffunction disorder.
hooray.
yes.
timmehahh! timmeh timmeh sibinlah timmih sibinlah timmih. timmuh timmuh timmuh.  timmeh!
yeah, what a dick. timmy's five times more talented than he is.
huh? no, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
we all have attention deficit disorder. so we all started taking ritalin.
rown! 
okay, children, let's settle down!  huhh i mean it; i want quiet!  my god, mr. hat, these children are so boring on ritalin.  huh, ah! alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. what do you think about that?!  vaginas, and penises. butt sex.  well, dammit, eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
gee, you seem a little stressed, mr. garrison. why don't you try some ritalin? 
rowr.
yeah. phil collins was right. people laughed at timmy, and timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
sounds good.
come, see him with us.
come on, drink it down. it's free.
rowr.
yeah. 
and they all lived happily ever after. except for pocket, who died of hepatitis b.  so ends charles dickens' great expectations. we hope you now have a deeper appreciation for pip, and indeed,  all masterpieces of literature like this one.  until next time, i'm a british person. good night.
dude, i don't understand this game at all.
um, deny it?
sweet.
what?
dude, that's not cool. don't give kyle aids.
we just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
you don't pay tax dollars, cartman! you're eight!
what?
you don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
i'm bill kurtis.
"i've outgrown all my friends. i need to meet more mature people, clyde frog.  oh, great idea, clyde frog!  i can meet new friends on the internet!  here's a chat room: ""men who like young boys""  that's perfect.  hi everybody! i am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. i am eight years old and would li-  wow! look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! i'll pick... tony316.  hi tony.  ""so what are you into?""  oh, you know, the usual stuff. smiley-face.  ""kewl. wanna get together?  smiley-face?""  sure, tony! that would be... kewl. winking, smiley, face.  ""meet me at mel's buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  sounds good. see you then! clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  you see that, clyde frog? tomorrow i'm gonna meet my first mature friend!"
yeah. you're -eric?
i brought you some candy.
and some books on kama sutra.
yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
huh?
no! 
(woohoo!) 
"okay, we'll try this again.  hi, everyone. i am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. i like to-  oh, this one looks good: hungdaddy.  hello, hungdaddy.  ""hi. i'm eight and a half inches."" damn, dude, this guy's tiny. he must be a dwarf.  sorry, i'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  midgets piss me off. frowny face.  lemme see, how about this one?"
hi there.
haah! eric!
oh, crap!
no-o!
blaaa-lalalalalalala.
we're making faces at sick people.
we don't know.
we don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
you're not more mature than us, cartman!
i've done it, kevin. i've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  do you know what this means, kevin? no more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. no more will mankind have to pick-  who could that be?  why, it's little eric cartman.
well of course, come in.
oh, eric, i'm afraid it's not that simple. genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where i can just make people.
oh. well, i happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. it's called, nambla.
yes. i have been a member for several years. i'm sure they'd let you join. you l-look about right.
what we need is proof that young boys want to be members of nambla. that they want love from us. we need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  can we... help you?
you... do?
oho, thank you. thank you, jesus.
(i don't know. but i've gotta think of something.) 
what are you talking about, fatass?
just a few more pictures, eric. you make a perfect poster child.
uh hey, eric, we have a surprise for you. we want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child.
yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. 
great, hnn. you go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.
oh, i'm not gonna make it. i'm gonna be sick!  oh, my stuhomach!  oh, my nose!  augh! 
they are?
we don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
we don't wanna go!
we don't wanna go!
kenny, what the hell are you doing?! 
we got invited too, fatass!
first and foremost, i wanna recognize eric cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys.
dude! we're surrounded by perverts.
yeah.
how?
huh?? uh-uh well, huh, why me?
well, sure, u-uh i'm a team player-uh, i guess.
huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? well just what team is this anyway?!
well uuh-uuh-alright then. 
well, cartman
yeah!
and now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
good morning, children. mr. garrison is away today. i am your substitute teacher, mr. wyland. 
okay, and where iiiiss… kenny mccormick?
dude, what the hell was that?
...dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
you have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
awww. 
kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.
(rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, pow.) 
(no, no.)
(unngh. stop, no! no, it's mine!)  (there! it's mine!) 
ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 
and don't get too close to kyle. he looks like he might have the aids. 
cartman, we have to ask you a question. a very serious question.
kyle's in trouble, cartman. i can see him getting worse right before my eyes. there might be a way that you... can save his life.
what kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
his mom is trying all this eastern medicine and new age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
alright. will you donate one of your kidneys to kyle?
but you only need one, fat boy!
(it's not that's fucking serious.) 
how much?
cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
what the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
come on, kyle. let's get out of here. 
let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.
oh well, we're busted. 
oh, phew.
...vein right, well-  well, here goes nothing. help me pull his pajamas up.  no way! kidney blocker 2000?!
you suck, cartman!
god-dammit, don't you care that kyle is gonna die?!
that's alright. if you'll all help, i think i have a plan.
oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. hwaa!  that son of a bitch!
dude, please. kyle needs it.
alright, alright, here. 
why, hello there, eric. 
oh, i see.  are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend kyle have it?
well, alright then. we'll get you prepped for surgery.  if you'll just sign this release. 
yeah.  hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too.
kyle's all better, cartman, thanks to you!
isn't that funny, sweetie?
oh. ...thanks?
huh?  what the?
i see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  pro-choice vs. cartman, pro-gun control vs. cartman, a-and people against the clubbing of baby seals vs. cartman. and apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been… cartman.
yeah.
you don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
no you don't!
okay. now, in order for us the debate to change the south park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. we will present our arguments based on things that w-
nice of you to show up! we were just discussing how we should state our case.
what??
wwuhuh-o-kay! 
right. 
cartman, we can't just attack stan and kyle's credibility. we need to present our side of the debate.
the south park flag!
d'aaaaahhh!
this might come in handy. it says here that recently a case was brought before the south carolina court about their flag, and they-
if we could show a parallel between the south carolina case-
cartman, why don't you just go home?! you aren't helping any!
that's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
i can't believe it. all the pressure's on us. i mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
huh?
hey, that's a pretty good point, cartman.
not bad at all. i may make that our first argument. 
double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. 
hey, that's what i always do, too!
yeah. jesus, i never thought i'd have anything in common with you, cartman.
aha ha.
well, anyway, let's get back to work. 
weird, um. okay. uh. now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  we can show that the- 
cartman! 
say it'll be like this forever.
phew. i'm sure glad that's over with. 
i can't believe how right bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. as soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
i'm totally back to normal. see you later. 
"fingerbang!
bang-bang!
fingerbang-bang!

i'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'cause i'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight

yes! yes! i'm a star! i'm a star! i'm--  aaawww, i'm nobody! god-damnit!  wait a minute. maybe that was a sign from god. that's it, isn't it? you want me to start a boy band so i can make $10 million dollars, don't you? that's it! 
...how?
boy band?
i'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
dude, we don't have any musical talent.
(that sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
wait a minute. there's only four of us.
so, all boy bands have five members.
he's right.

dude, what are you talkin' about? that was awesome!
come on, nobody's gonna notice.
(me too.)
yeah!
cartman, it's six in the morning. do we have to rehearse this early?
costumes? 
hey, cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
i wanna be the tough one.
i wanna be the tough one!
jews are tough!
since abraham, fatass!
"hey, cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?"
kenny says that's not what it means.
(it's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
now, i know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. it can be very dangerous.
excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?
you have to make an appointment first. now move along, sir.
jesus christ!
well, i guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
cool.
jesus, they're gonna start a riot! 
what? hey. who are you? 
o-o-oh. what? how'd you get in here? hey.
what? o-oh. you wanna play at the mall? like tiffany?
oh. well, i guess. ...what?
"i'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life

who?? no!
well uh, uh, oh... right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. and i would uh, i'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. what?
no. i mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
oh! oh-h, hello eric.
wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, eric, i'll see if i can help you out. 
alright, eric, what's the matter?
well, eric, i, i think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. they're all based on the gomlich effect.
"the law of physics that states, ""if one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. and then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."""
all they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. they're crazy!  uh-uh, except for lilian, of course. 
you're welcome. now, go away!
a-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!

wow. there must be at least 20 people out there. 
he'll be here. stan wouldn't douche.
hey. uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?
well hurry up. i can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. 
(yeah!)
hm... well, let's just walk away then. 
alright, kids, uh, that does it. you're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.
sorry. get out! 
it's stan!

can i get your autograph?
move along, ma'am.  eh, that was pretty good, kids. maybe you can come perform at my elks club sometime.
yeah.
hey, cartman, do you think god's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
uh, god is our refuge and strength, m'kay. a very present help in trouble, m'kay.  therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...

boys! you are in church! 
we have to go to sunday school so we don't burn! 
well, hopefully not. that's why you're gonna need to receive communion.
what if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
"it doesn't matter, because we are all born with original sin. now, let me explain how communion works.  the priest will give you this round cracker,  and he will say, ""the body of christ,"" and then you eat it. "
"in the book of mark, jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body."""
and then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the blood of christ.
eric, do you wanna go to hell?!
then stop questioning me.
okay, let's see. uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
and thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
no-o-o-o-o!
oh good. i don't?
i am not!
now, let's see. what about the time we set mr. garrison's cat on fire?
timmiih!
timmiih!
hail mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. blessed art though amongst wo-
uh- aw, dude, you screwed me up!
the guy in there said i have to say 54 hail marys. now i can't remember if i was on number seven or eight.
i don't know. you can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
well, here goes everything. 
blessed art thou, child. now, what do you have to confess?
uugh. this really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.  i'll see if i can find him. bye. 
your  con- confession does not leave this box.
oh. well, uh arr-i'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.
i... see.
okayokay, fine! 
what happened??
okay, you'd better baptize kyle some more.
haaaah!
cartman!
"dude, you just said ""ass""! that's a sin!"
(fuck! oops!) 
but what about them?
he had sins that he didn't confess!
...we've gotta get to that church before we die.
yeah. sure. okay.
oh no! it's locked!
confession box is over there! 
oh, huhuh.
you're a sinner!
oh! huh huh. huh huh.  oh, forgive me, heavenly father! i've sinned against you!
dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
no, i can't.  what am i doing? i know this is the wrong thing to do. i could lose chris. i can't do this.  i can't do this. 
pamphlet. pamphlet. 
i don't wanna to go to hell. 
dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
i told him he couldn't do it. 
don't listen to them, kids. you have to go to school.
i will.
¿qué?
it's not that, kyle. it's just that eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  just really quick; she says it's very important.
wow, cool.
what?
aww.
(cartman?! cartman, you've gotta help me, and i'm not foolin' around!)
what?
ask him what hell is like.
no! not like this..!
wagghh..!
whoa!
marcy! you're coming home this instant!
you're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
stephen?  stephen, no!
forgive us, lord.
awww.
eric, sister anne has come to visit you.
eric, you need to stop what you're doing. you need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.
yes, eric. a lot more than you have.
eric, the lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. that wouldn't make sense. he wants people to live their lives.
no.
...and i'm gonna save all of you right now.  i'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
ow!  goo-aagh..! 
yes!
yes!
ow! 
uh, i think so.
praise the lord. hallelujah! praise god! 
timmiiiy!
timmiiiy!
haagggh.
haagggh.
haghh.
timmilih? 
oh-aagghhh! 
do dodo dum do dododo dodo dum do dodo
denver.
wooooo!
hooray!
yes!
wagh...
no, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this iraqi dictator, saddam hussein,  was killed by a pack of wild boars. i remember when i first met him in hell. it was a lovely morning in april...
oooh, yeah. i'll do that.
what worked?
you're keeping that money yourself?
wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. you mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
well, what about going to hell and all that?!
then why didn't you tell us?!
the only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
hell, you can't leave me, satan! i won't let you! 
alright kids, it's time to go. it's time for this to stop!
jesus!
kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
god doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising his name. god wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. that's how you live for him.
yeah. 
but eric, i think this time i have to teach you a lesson. i'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
(eric! eric!)
stupid third grader!
uhuhuhow.
denver? 
yeah!!!
huhuh, look at all this stuff.
play time is over, children! do you understand me?!  i don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  and it is time to go to work!
well, young man, i hope you have a good explanation for this.
this is the fourth grade! you need to grow up! 
now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
and did you see her lazy eye? you can't even tell what she's looking at.
i just didn't think it would come so soon.
huh?
huh-it sure was.
it can't be that bad. people do it on tv all the time.
well, what about those two college guys next door to me? they're always doing science experiments in their basement.
when it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. the spock theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. the lieutenant commander data theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
alright, children, i hope you all did your homework last night. please pass your papers up to the frontuh.
i said, pass your papers to the fronteh!
it's choksondik! and you are all going to have detention!
what are you doing?!
well, well, well! i'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
no! he actually thinks there's 72.!
"look! there aren't 73 episodes of star trek, there are 72! ""the menagerie"" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! pizza-face is wrong!"
and live in a world of 72 original star treks? i don't think so! i don't want to live in that world. 
alright, children, i hope you all did your-  oowhat is going on now?! 
oh good gravy, not this again.
i'll kill you! 
children, get back into your seats!
eric, i mean it!
present them. 
thah... that's what mr. garrison would've said.
yeah! you suck, cartman! 
cool!
goddammit, cartman! you only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
he's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
he's smarter than you, fat boy! i don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! i thought--
i was held back ten human grades.  i mean, grades. do you companion-friends know eric cartman?
eric cartman?  and you have a dawson's creek trapper keeper futura s 2000?
yes. yes, i do.
no, i don't! i don't care!
broflovski, i had your older brother kyle in my third-grade class. he's a very smart kid. i'm sure you are, too.  well that's bad news for everybody else, because i will be grading you all on a curve. 
trapper keeper active.
ready for hybrid. 
may i hold your trapper keeper?
oh, you are so full of crap, cartman! metal spikes will not come out!
i'm gonna!
ahhh, hello eric. can i be your human friend?  i mean, friend?
please. we can have fun and play games, like human four square--  i mean, four square.
oh, i see. alright, i'll pay 100 geliga stones-- uh, i mean, human dollars! eugh, i mean dollars!
can we play some human tetherball?
serve! 
got it!
waa-agggh! 
oh, for christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
eric, i'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
wagh!
whoa, dude..!
please. you do not understand.
and so, eric. now you see why we must destroy your trapper keeper.
cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
yes!
well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. i am still here, but i shouldn't be here. if trapper keeper has been stopped, then i should not exist. but here i am. something is still not right.
cartman! you still got a trapper keeper!
cartman, you dumbass! you can't get a new one!
because if your trapper keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this trapper keeper and not the one before!
we will have to destroy this trapper keeper.
don't you get it?! you can't have any trapper keepers, fat ass!
cartman!
recharging.
sweet. you're so cool, trapper keeper. i would never let those assholes take you away. i don't wanna wait for my trapper keeper to be overthe ways of my trap--
oh, cool.
well, come on. let's go upstairs and get cartman's trapper keeper ourselves. 
open up, cartman! we're taking your trapper keeper! 
trapper keeper, ready to ensorb.
trapper keeper, ready for hybrid.
not-- aw, damnit..! 
i'm going to try and break you away from the computer, cartman. i need to remove the cpu.
screw you, fat ass!
cartman! 
huh, that's a bitch.
hey! whoa whoa whoa, cartman! all you've been doing is making fun of kyle and now he's saved your life! you at least owe him a thank you!
cartman!
e-yes. perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
can we take a lunch break now?
agh oh-ight, timmih!
the kindergartners! i just came from their dress rehearsal. hoh, it's good, you guys. it's real good!
oh yeah, we can't!
revamp how? the rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the helen keller story.
yeah
okay!
aw, blow it out your ass!
now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. something that sets up the entire show.
gobbles! 
gobbles! 
i didn't do anything to you. timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. what do you want me to say to him?
during my years on broadway i... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. she even jumped through a hoop of fire.
gobbles!  gobbles!  up, heh. uh!  heeey, gobbles!  gobbles.  gobbles! 
boopsie-kins, it's late. you need to be in bed.
now, hon!
twenty more minutes, and that's it. 
tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
oh.  cool! he's here! 
ap ap! do not call them tricks! she's a very sensitive turkey! she performs feats, not tricks. ladies and gentlemen, may i present the most beautiful bird in america!  four-time prize winner of the national western stock show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! i give you alinicia! 
wow.
of course she is! 
what... is... that?!
gobbles.
dude, don't forget: timmy is the only kid who can play helen keller. don't piss him off.
tim-mih.
my turkey does not work with other turkeys!
alright, ah ah alright! alri- ah a-alright. alright. 
she's not coming out. she's very upset! she's pooped all over the room!
kill the other turkey!
"well, it could meet with ""an unfortunate accident."""
it's very simple! either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your helen keller thanksgiving musical!
how can she talk if she can't hear? this is absolutely pointless!
whoa-aaaa 
but what are we gonna do?
thanks. 
how is it going, eric?
well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.
let's see.  helen keller was blind and deaf.  perhaps you should see what it is like. deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. here. 
just relax. just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... 
well, did you see anything?
...oh, that's too bad.
gobbles.
cartman, where's timmy's turkey?
she's brilliant! everyone loves her so far. 
timmih?
gobbles!! 
he's gone, dude! butters says he saw him leave.
i do. i know the part. if i must, i can go on.
i cannot hear what they are saying. i cannot tell them how i feel.
aaaa, timmih!
oh. oh, wow! wowuh! 
alright, see you next year, parents. 
waitwait. hunh.
aahahahahahahaaa!
eh yes, sweetie.
oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  mommy's  expecting  some company.
god, i have to everything around here!
eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. m'kay?
we believe that you might have a problem.
your friends and i have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
yes, fat camp.
yeah, except for me. i just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
oh, we'll change that.  hello, camper. my name is rick. how are you doing?
oh.  well, goodbye, sweetie.
have you got any candy?
heh! it was a lady in a costume!
doing great kids! come on! 
well, i sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! how about you, gang?
are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
me neither. i have to have sugar or i'm going to die.
i have some fudge 'ems up my ass. you want some?
psss. yeah, i'm not falling for that one again!
can i interest you in some ice cream?
alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 
they tricked us again, huh?
i made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. who wants some?
oh, there you are. alright, i got the goods. some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy.
nobody. your mom even thinks i'm a skinny you.
uh uh. one thing. i want a bigger cut.
i'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! all you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!
twenty.
fine! then i shall bid you good day! 
they'll do it!! 
two donuts and a pack of licorice, please.
'cause i'm always gonna be fat. i don't wanna eat no sweets, but i can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this.  all my life i've been fat. i've beh- i've been to seven camps and i swore to my momma that i'd lose the weight. i want to, but i can't help myself. 
i'd, i do?
oh, don't thank us. we failed you.
wait a second! this isn't right!  it's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! mom, dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! eric cartman's been sneaking in junk food!
well, what the heck. maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? 
yeah.
bubbye. 
hepatitis b?
well, of course your parents said you can't go!
ah. oh, now i already told them.
they're evil! i wish i didn't have any parents!
how?!
the police?
what's that?
who cares? my parents deserve whatever they get. they're liars and cheats.
"""my parents molestered me."""
"what's ""bad touch""?"
okay, molestered, bad touch.
dude! having no parents is awesome! i'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
the following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
what's going on?
...nothing.
the mayor! good! finally!
you're the mayor? what the hell is gong on here?! where are your parents?!
no parents in the entire town? what happened to them?
look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
no phones, either? how do you communicate?
it's gonna be about three days. 
spitball!
oh no. no!  aaaah! 
uh, uh...
sure, outlander. i'll get it 
outlander! 
oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
fishing's good. uh huh. 
mmrrhhhh!
no. if they have it, one of ours will die for carousel!
enough of this! you kids are all in big trouble! 
it's time for carousel! haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! that means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
be careful, mark. they'll make you disappear with the m word.
ten days?? it's only been ten days since they left??
sure. 
it's mr. hankey! he hasn't shown up yet.
it's only three days until christmas, you guys! you know how bad things have been around here. i think it might be because mr. hankey hasn't come.
if you guys want there to be a christmas, you'd better come help me!
dude, you sneezed on my back!
i know, kyle. i've just been awfully busy with my family.  honey!
i know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
sure we'll help! 
honey, can we go inside for a second?  well, it's decided, kids. tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of christmas!
good grief! we need a christmas tree for our play.
jesus, this sucks! all they keep doin' is dancing around!
and why is it that on charlie brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
how hard can it be? look at it. 
whoa!
that's not me, that's you!
they kind of look like us.  i mean, stan's got blue eyes and i've got a sharper nose, but i mean, they kinda look like us.
what's a hard p?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
"dreidel dreidel dreidel,
i made you out of clay,
dreidel dreidel dreidel--"
don't you oppress me, fat boy.
cartman!
that took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
citizens of south park, the colorado film commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own south park children. 
cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! you quit!
sure. sh-sure, mr. hankey.
yeah. and you know? i think i've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're christian or jewish or atheist or hindu.  christmas still is about one very important thing.
no not ham!
are you kidding? i think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
wow! count me in!
yeah - no - i'd, it, it sounds really cool.
what, doughboy?
so?
what?
what?!
what?!
goddamnit, cartman! what are they gonna say on cop drama?
"they can't say ""shit"" on television!"
(dude! we've gotta watch!)
bu- but i got these tickets to see lion king on stage.
it's stupid!
i told you, we don't have a record of that. and besides, -
"jesus christ! another commercial? are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
i can't believe they actually said it. 
well! i hope it lived up to all the hype! you must feel so much better now!
do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  it's still the same old world out there. look.  what the hell?
yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
"you can only use it in the non-literal sense. for instance,  ""that's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. hoever, the literal noun form of  ""this is a picture of shit."" is still naughty. "
yes, that's now fine.
"it's not new!! i'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!"
"this sucks. now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore."
what's meecrob?
"haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? it all started when they said ""shit"" on television."
what's that?
oh.
because it brings a curse? like the black death.
cartman, this is serious!!!
holy shit!
(uh oh.)
hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. if you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  and over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  well, we should be arriving in los angeles in about two hours. until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. 
then  get out of here before we have you thrown out!
and asshole.
all the world destroyed?
wait! 
agh. dude, lame. lame!  bummer, dudes. 
and besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. we believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of english.
holy shi-  poop.
was your dad in scouts, cartman? oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
hyeah timmay!
hey, fellas!
hey, i have a great idea! why don't we see if jimmy wants to come be in our scout club?
we told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
yahahah!!!
that's better.
"well, i sure have met a lot of interesting people here in south park.  h-how about that eric cartman kid, huh? ""goddamnit! god-. no, kitty, that's my pot pie! goddamnit! eh, goddamnit!"" "
timmih! 
that is enough, scouts! take your seats! 
"aw, what is this?! if there's one thing i hate, it's a whining platoon! ""we don't wanna do pushups! we don't wanna get up early! we don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"""
big gay al, what are you doing?!
kicked out? oh no!
puppies. puppies for sale.
timmih, timmh.
timmih.
cripple fight! 
uh yeah, ah i think so.
that's pretty cool, dude!
he's a magician named david blaine, dude. he kicks ass.
"""david blaine workshop. learn all about david blaine at the center for magic."" dude, we gotta go."
oh yes, you see, david blaine is much more than a magician. he's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
if you look through david blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. let's read some of the book together, shall we?
that's right.
i'm kyle.
uh oh. my husband warned me about you blainiacs. i'm sorry, but i'm a catholic.
so you're not a cult?
well, alright, come on in.
...and if you look here, you can see how david blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at times square.
no, not really.
david blaine is doing a big performance in denver tomorrow night.  we're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
oh, i can't go.
i am happy.
yes i am.
i really am.
but i am.
that's 15 people we got to agree to come see david blaine perform in denver.
i think if we try kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
it's jesus! 
my children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. you should be using your money and time for other things. these are simple magic tricks. his magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  behold! i have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  ya need tuh- turn around.  okay, now turn back. 
get your things ready. we leave for washington at dawn!
cartman! cartman, wake up! cartman!
it's just me.
dude. i don't think i wanna be a part of this anymore.
i think stan might've been right. anyway, i think it's going too far. i mean, if i kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
i think we should bail. if we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
okay. okay, you're right.  oh uh cartman: thanks.  cartman?  what the hell? 
what have you done, cartman?!
you must understand, brother kyle, twah, you know too much about the church. if you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.
cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
he-e-ey george! what's gon' on?
cartman! we've been brainwashed, don't you see? we don't have to do this!
we've gotta stop that oversized abraham lincoln! mohammad!  great scott!
it worked. now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 
your my super best friend too, kyle.
haha, hehahaha.
and so, jesus and his companions leave washington. but their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the super best friends!
what the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
what's no big deal?
...what the hell are you talking about?!
oh.  no you didn't!
he's lying. 
hell no! 
we don't wanna see them, cartman! 
uh what are those? 
what??
scott tenorman? the ninth grader?
cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
when you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
yuh huh!
because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy scott tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
yeah.

scott tenorman is an eighth grader who sold cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now cartman's all pissed off.
wuh what are you gonna do?
what's in it for us?
yeah, why should we all care about getting scott tenorman back for you?
timmay!
euuh, livin' a lie, timmih. 
eric! are you training that pony to please you?!
oh. well, does mr. denkins know you're usin' his pony? he shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
alright, then.  wait, why the hell are you trainin' denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
well, son, i think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 
step 1: find someone's weakness. step 2: exploit that weakness.
what do you see? 
no, young hunter. i mean, what do you see? you must learn all you can about your kill.
oo what's a radiohead?
oh, jesus, don't start singing, ned!
nice thinking, young hunter.
what?
mn let me see.
whoa, i gotta get out of here! 
uh huh.
oh, cool. um, thanks for tellin' me.
you're welcome, scott. 
welcome back to mtv. we're here with the members from radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  guys, when is the next album coming out?
that's an interesting question, kurt. but first i'd just like to say that i really hate this kid named scott tenorman. he's stupid.  yeah, i hate scott tenorman too.  i think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
and will there be a new tour?
well, we would tour, but we just hate that scott tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  yeah. scott tenorman is totally not cool! he's not cool!
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing pube boy! 
oh my god, he killed kenny.
that does it! i'm gonna get scott tenorman once and for all!!!
okay, cartman, what do you want?
got what all figured out?
oh, jesus!
okay, so what's the plan?
yeah.
...what?
you're such a dumbass, cartman. 
see ya. 
hey.
ooo, a chili carnival, huh? that sounds great.
wow, a pony ride. neat.
gosh. chili, rides, and ponies? what more could i want?
what?
how can i turn it down?
yeah! 
this is the dumbest thing you've ever done, cartman.
oho, we will. trust us. we won't miss this. 
oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get scott tenorman back. is radiohead here yet?
hello, eric!
i made some chili to enter into the contest.
this is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
it's my special recipe.
oh, i wouldn't miss this for anything.
just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
well i don't want it to get cold. i think i can win first prize.
alright, i guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
mmm. ah, i don't know. your chili is pretty good, cartman, but i think mine is better. try it.
eh, it's a special recipe.
i'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, i have some'in' to tell you.
what?!
my... mom and dad are... dead? 
oh my god!  oh my god!! 
no, wait! waaiittt!! oh my god, oh my gaawwwd!!  noooo!
good call.
"and so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money,  she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley.  and so ends ""punky brewster, behind the blow."""
oh man, this is another rerun.
oh my god!
i got 'em! four tickets, 68th row, to terrance and phillip! i waited in line since 3 this morning!
and terrance and phillip are more important than mother earth?
uuuuhh.
dude, what the hell is going on?! why did they replace phillip?
"then get in the ""official presidents of the terrance and phillip fan club"" line. "
you and about a thousand other people at one time or another. now, get out of my face! 
are you guys official presidents, too?
i don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
oh!!! 
well, guys, i guess we're going to canada.
ah, i'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. it's old and stale! i mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 
i didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. look, all we have to do is get them there, right? once terrance and phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
good luck, boys. 
jesus, man, those earth day people don't screw around!
they're back!
it sure did.
...and so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to mabel louise cartman.  she was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother , and a loving grandmother .
ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.
and now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how mabel touched our lives. 
peace. 
no, sweetie, we have to tend to some of grandma's business.
"...""and so i leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family."""
"""to my loving son, stinky: i leave you the house in nebraska. look after it as your father and i did."""
"""to my grandson eric: you are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."""
"""for you, eric, i leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."""
that can't be!
yes, eric, it's yours.
and now, you do.
...nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million. 
eric, that is a lot of money. don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
on what?
excuse me son, i'm an investment broker; i can help you invest that money.
eric, god could sure use that money for a bigger church.
what the hell are you doing, fatass?!
kenny wasn't lying.
dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
your grandma left it to you! you didn't earn it!
are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
what?
sshhhh. it ain't right, chris.  the truth is, the park is a financial flop. i haven't turned a profit in years because i can't keep attendance up.
you... you're not?
mr. cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 
look. cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. i mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? i'll bet he's sick of it already.
hunh, i guess you're right.
we're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
ah! ow! hey, it hurts!  owie-ow! help! ow, that hurts!
hohohooho! oowwww!
hoh gohod, i popped it!! oh hit huhurts!!
alright, let's go.
you'll see! we'll get in! 
so what does does this job pay?
uh, i'm afraid i don't really like rides.
i'm not interested.
if you need security, i need a cash salary.
well, look: why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.
this place is huge. you'll never notice two people. and then you'll have security for your park.
i will shoot on sight.
no! i finally do understand! there is no justice! there is no god! do you hear me?! i renounce my faith!!
that's gay.
oh. 
aw. 
hoh boy, oh boy! 
we're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
yeah! but i think it's broke down. the cars aren't moving.
what?
uh, i'm security, not maintenance.
well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. you need to hire a maintenance person.
ogh, alright, alright! i'll let two more people in each day so i can hire a maintenance person.
timmay!
mike gainor. 
goddamnit cartman, let me in!
it is stupid, cartman! you made kyle lose his faith in god, you fat asshole!
aggh!  this isn't over, cartman!
then i was right. job has all his children killed, and michael bay gets to keep making movies. there isn't a god.
kyle? kyle?  get the doctor!
(woohoo!)  (heeheehee!!) 
oh, if i could only have a park that worked like this!
oh, hello. congratulations on your success.
what?
...but it's doing great!
daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?
goddamnit, get the fuck out of my way!!! 
oh kyle! kyle, you've got to fight!
excuse me? eric cartman?
i'm frank garrett with the irs. you haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  seize the assets. 
there's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. the family's entitled to the rest of this. 
you still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, mr. cartman. we'll see you in court. 
we know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
nohoho way, josé!
"""i don't care,"" said pierre. ""i'm from france."" "
then damnit man, do it!
huh?
huh?
move along, sir! you are vandalizing private property!
that's it, baby. that's it.
look, kyle, cartman is totally miserable.  even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
whoa! awesome!
oh no, what now?
(wait until you see what i can do to the dog!)
cartman, what the hell are you doing?
(yeah they do!)
that's awesome!
i had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
"you ""beat off?"""
wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
yuh huh! if you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get aids.

would you rather them do it unprotected?
how the heck should i know?  why, it's just a little doughnut.  hoh- it's all gooey.
ha-a how come i gotta go first?

i've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. you know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. it's important.

brake, kenny, brake. 
huh where are you goin'?
towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his tna. but then, one day, towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. again.
hurry up, stupid parachute!
hey it's been a long time!
don't preach to me, fatso!
you're stupid!
that tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! we are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring tynacorp down!
truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! 
oooww! 
(help help! heeelllppp!)

these are a weapon! 
i'll think of a way. now move along!
alright class, as some of you may have heard, the president has asked that american children all send one dollar to the children of afghanistan.  so i have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.
eric, the afghan people need our help!
we're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with afghanistan! and the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
the afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in afghanistan! that's it! end of discussion!
i told you: those afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
my parents will never let me keep a goat
excuse me?
aaagh!

you mean, you don't want towelie around?
shhh. there we go. you're gonna be okay, goat. you'll be back in afghanistan in about 20 hours.

that isn't funny, cartman.
no it's not, cartman. you know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
...okay cartman, what do you want this time?
...dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
...nuh uh.
hello, we're mr. and mrs. thompson. 
we understand you've seen our son. 
yeah, you missed them turning around.
what?
blew a funny fuse?
okay eric, as your counselor, uh i want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
well, i can't think of anything that would be that funny.
oh, i see, well... well, what did you used to think was funny?
well eric, i suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
"it's possible, hm'kay?  but you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""friends"" . ohokahay, huhuh."

dude, what's wrong with you?
well, hello, eric. i was really glad you called me, very much.
what's this all about?
gee, that's a terrible thing, eric. um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
oh, i don't think that'll be hard. i've been working on my rr... routine.
okay. try this one on for size: why did the... pigeon cross the road?
because it was having sex with the chihi... because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken.

dear mom: i can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and i can't go out to face it anymore. please tell everyone why i won't be at school.
and please buy me more chocolate guns. i'm starting to run out.
oh, son! 
well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
hey, you're laughing, cartman.
well wait a minute. don't you see what happened?
oh, you're right. cartman had a feeling of remorse.
there is no such thing as a funny fuse, cartman. you felt bad.
hey dude.
cartman, i'm gonna make you a deal.
that kid over there is my cousin from the east coast. he's having a really hard time right now, so i'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
but you can't make fun of him at all. no smartass comments, nothin'.
and you especially can't say anything about jews!
i can't believe how cold it is out here.
ot- nice to meet you, cartman. yuh you know, i saw that same jacket you're wearing at bosco's for $29.95. how much was yours? um, i juh- i was just wondering if bosco's is a ripoff?
cartman?!
oh well, i i grew up in the shity, ah ah i really don't care for it. ah i come from a jewish family, which of course you already know, because kyle's from the same family.  i like to read, and i have these polyps on the backs of my hands - i don't know what they are.
...oh, and i hope one day to be an investment banker.
ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? i usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
now kyle, i need you to be quiet. in my class you need to be able to concentrate.
concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
oh my god.
yeah! they were, cartman!
you did, too! you are so full of crap!
you blew the deal, cartman!
oh no.
think he'll be alright?
okay, cartman, you're it. start counting. 
i hope he doesn't suffocate.
yeah, haha.
yeah. you see, i've learned something today.  sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... let's see, what did i learn about?  what did i learn about today?
dude! weak.
okay. whose project should we look at next? how aboouuut eric?  eric cartman?
now eric!
haha!
you just put that thing together just now! i'm giving you a check minus.
siddown. 
what did you say?!
alright! 
eric, for the love of god. 
my family isn't rich.
but i...
aharmani exchange?
s-son, can you just hurry it up? i don't think we quite fit n here.
i sure did.
yeah, dude.  nobody does. they're too expensive.
i only have this.
what's a vhs?
oh, frederick, this is wonderful!
i don't know. we don't have horses, so we can't play.
alright.
i'll kick you in the nuts, cartman! 
and cartman for being fat.
and cartman for being stupid.
and cartman for having a whore for a mom.
and cartman for being a sadistic asshole
come on, nurse token. we're gonna play football, you puss.
"...going places that i've never been
seeing things that i may never see a- uuugh!  jesus christ!! "
alright, cartman! what's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
what?
a trampoline?
a boat?
(a football machine?)
well what, cartman?
...what? 
i'm leaving right now! 
you've never watched the news, fatass!  and what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
they're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
...i hate you so much. 
fine! i don't need you assholes! i can sell these fetuses all on my own!
can i help you?
oh, right, the fetuses. we were very lucky you called. our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
oh larry! this young man has some new fetuses for research.
oh well, i'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.
too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. it's too bad, too. we really coulda helped a lot of people.
no! this can't happen! kenny can't die! kenny can't die!! 
sweetie, your friends are downstairs. they need to see you.
they say it's an emergency.
uh, yeah?
eh, just about.
oh. well, uh okay. 
right.  uh hello? is this mr. thompson with anatomy research? ...yes, uh, hello sir. uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...you're breaking my balls. ...i said, you're breaking my balls, mr. thompson. ...my, my balls.
cartman.  kenny's in the hospital.
they told us he has a m-muscular disease. an and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
i'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, eric. we thought you might wanna come.
(i'm okay, i guess.)
heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
i'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
okay, we're gonna need to get kenny some time to sleep now.
cartman?
cartman, were you... crying?
hey cartman.  i care a lot about him, too. 
this is where the bulk of our research was being done. but due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.
look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. but before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. sort of like a blank cell. do you understand?
because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. you see this rat? earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.
nerve cells damaged by parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
that's the theory.
well, no. to build another shake's it would be better to use lumber.
but, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.
where are you going?
hey kid.  give 'em hell. give 'em hell. 
oh, hey kid.  good luck. good luck. 
i think i understand.

shone in your eyes"
oh, i don't know.
seventy-five dollars? well, alright.
we're not going to the abortion clinic. i'm going to have this baby.
oh mark, i love you.
i let kenny down. i'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
what, cartman?
what, cartman? what's happened?
this whole time, you were just using kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
i actually hugged you. i held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
aaargh! 
ye-!  wait, what?
yeah. boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
line
herro, shitty wok, take your order prease.
yes, this shitty wok.
now gosh darnit, my name's not not-kenny!
alright! 
well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. but the way that i lost so much weight was that i got aides.
yeah, it's only in america that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
tha- that's diarrhea.
then city wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
that's a great idea!
me?!
oh, no, i thought you meant you. eh, you're the fat one.
but butters isn't fat.
but fellas, if i get fat my parents will ground me.
"you wouldn't be a penis-butt, butters, you'd be famous. just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
his name is butters, it's butters. "
now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
fifty pounds? why?
i'm runnin' out, children. 
dude, that isn't cool. you shouldn't joke about kenny being dead. enough time hasn't passed.
twenty-two point three years. that's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
wull i can't eat no more. i-i just keep pukin' it up.
no!
w-well, k-kinda like cartman.  aw!
welcome to shitty wok. you rike to try shitty chicken today?
which one? i see two fat friends.
oh! you mean like-a jared?!
all right!
his name is jared. jared lost weight eating subway and... sandwiches of...
wuh hey now, they do too! uh, my mom and dad - love me even if i am fat.
well alright then.
yeah, we're all set.
well, what do you mean?
that's true. jared did like a hundred for subway sandwiches.
wow! 
well, i know, ah i can't seem to lose it.
well ah i don't know what to tell ya. losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
all prepared for liposuction surgery?
okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
woahhh!
okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
whoa. i think this is a bad idea, fellas. i feel woozy.
the liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
waaaahh!
alright, it's working!
we've gotta hurry this up. 
he's losing weight. 
oh no, dude, butters' parents are home.
wuh well i told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, i can't play outside for five days.
yep.
look, fellas, i can't do it! my mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure i am here. if i don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know i'm- i'm up to no good!
no- but you don't sound like me.
alright, it's settled.come on, butters. 
don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
i'm just checking in on you, butters.  heh- do i hear the television? we told you no television while you're grounded!
jacking it? jacking what?
what?! are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
oh you're gonna get it mister! just wait until i get home!
god no!  oh, phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
huh. huh, uh, uh.
wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
hoh boy! mom and dad didn't... find out i... left the house, did they?
hu-oh! goody!
uh- perfect.
uh hey, uh eric?  uh- thanks for coverin' for me. you're a real pal.
aaaa!! 
well, our son is a perfect void-filler. it's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!
he's such a douchebag
yeah, and then what?
no, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
it's lovely. thank you.
what
what's a hitler?
no, i never have.
goooood mornin', fellas! all set to go skiin'?!  a-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
do you guys smell that? it smells bad out here, too. i'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
all right, little dudes,  great to see you out here. my name is thumper, and i'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. 
...french fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, cartman.
let's dance. 
hey kenny! 
hello, maury. 
cool!
what disease should we say?
what? 
cool!
we-ell hold on a second, you guys.
it has to be you, butters. think about it.
we know. believe me, we know. we're reminded every day that you're not kenny because kenny... was cool.
well, come on guys. if butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, i guess we know where we stand. 
we made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside.
aw, i feel silly.
why the hell would they want that anyway?  episode i sucked balls.
that's your flight, butters.
ho-old on a minute, guys, i've changed my mind. i don't wanna go.
doing all this to bring us back a prize. what a great friend! 
our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
"they sure do. they always say to me, ""butters, you're not kenny."" but i never said i was kenny. they say kenny would do this and kenny would do that-"
phew.
wait, here it is, here it is!
wow!
yeah! we thought of the whole thing!
euh! once again butters is tryin' to screw us over! that asshole!
i'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. we're looking for people for a new topic.
please help my out-of-control child.
really?  is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
well that's great! if you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
...my, my mom?
yes, sweetie?
what's that, my little man?
hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. you're my perfect little gum drop.

well, let's bring him out. here's eric cartman! 
ooo, he loves playing with his clyde frog and wellington bear.
oooohhh!
oh, what-evah. you ain't tough, ho! i roam with gangs!
what evah! you ain't bad! you ain't nothin'! i ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
what evah!
whatevah. i helped in a drive-by shooting.
wait! come back, uh-... maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!
whoa, thank god that's over. now i can get back home. 
get him!
now, out here you can see our cattle. this is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. 
hey, anybody want a free sample?
huh, me neither.
what??
well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. they'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.
pst, cartman.
cartman, wake up!
come on, we've gotta go!
we're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
'cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
so we can't let 'em die, douchebag! you're our friend; now come help us!
damnit butters, will you shut up?!
yes we do. we're those little baby cows' only hope. will you help us?
what?!
screw you, cartman!
no!
have butters kiss it.
awww! 
okay, very funny cartman, now come on!
hyaaaa! 
yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  how does this thing work, cartman?
okay, that's far enough. i'm going to go delta.
i said that's far enough!  don't be scared, little baby cow. we're here to set you loose.  there you go. you're free. run away!  go! they're gonna murder you.
you need to freeze some of your ass off.
they aren't leaving.
i don't know.
we're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  come on, you guys. 
eh! 
check it out, you guys. i'm calf-curling. 
don't be so sure. because i'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. real ugly. when all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. so if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
yeah!
well that's fine! you boys can just stay in there and starve to death. us parents are going to go to pizza shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.
round one is over. we made it. 
good night, patches. good night, halloway. good night, nepture. good night, davis. good night, bud. good night, red. good night, paulette. good night, chastity.
butters, i'm going to kill you over and over again.
we didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
no, cartman, we're not eating a calf!
wait, what is that?  dude!
see? now we can hold out for weeks!
me neither.
that's fine! you guys can live off of flesh, but i'm never eating meat again!
if we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.for a... brighter tomorrow...
ew, they're all dirty.
what do i say??
i'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. you want that, right?
how about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.
well, how about you send out one of the calves?
just one, that's all we want.
dude! 
what? i, i can't do that.
no no wait, oh, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. yuh, you're right. what reason do you have to trust me? i'm just a guy from lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? just a blue-collar guy like your dad.
hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? did you people go to negotiator school? no, you didn't!  get them on the line for me!
alright, you see that? i keep my end of the bargain.
well, ha- how about you send out two calves?
o-ogh...
i'm sorry, i'm sorry.  damnit, i'm losing them.  okay, i'm sorry. just send out one calf.
stan's getting worse, you guys.
how are we doin'?
"weh ah i did manage to get the fda to officially change the word ""veal"" to ""tortured baby cow."" "
but i couldn't get you north and south dakota.
all right boys, we have your truck. and we have an airplane on the tarmac at denver international.
pick me up. i... i want to see. 
all right! woohoo! yeah!
where am i supposed to drive to?
captain, where am i supposed to drive to?
this whole thing is ridiculous!
captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. 
okay cartman!
mexico here we come! 
we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.
alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. hit it! 
oh no! no!!
i'm not killing anybody!
we've got an iv of pure beef blood pumping into stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
chips, pop, cookies, kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the tv room for anythng!
no, turds!
shut up, fat turd!!
dude, i'm not going.
stan.
kyle.
butters! aw, i lose, huh?
dude, thank god for stupid people 
what a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. 
just don't mess with it, cartman.
just just leave it alone.
that's worse!
god-dammit cartman! you broke it!
dude, the commercials could start any time!
hurry! we can't miss the commercials!
hey! imong telling dat!
this is tianinman square. lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93.  these chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. let's see if we can get in for a closer look.  oi!  i've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. you can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end.  gotcha mate!  ah, you wanna fight, huh?!  think you could take me, you little buggers?! 
aww! 
whoa, wait fellas.  we can't go to my house.
it's a burning flag.
-bloomin' taj mahal.
we made it!
russell crowe?? children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
well?? you all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight?  crikey, you've done it now!
the bar! they've got a tv at the bar!
we made it.
look, this is a bar! we can't have children in here. people come here for debauchery and sin!
come on, we gotta get to a tv! 
no, that didn't work. did i set the internal clock? uh, no.  oh, really? well, how do i do that?
has russell lost tugger for good? find out after these messages.
and now back to russell crowe, fightin' around the world!
yeah. we don't like this show.
please.
awww!
that'd disgusting, dude!
i told you, we can't go to my house!
aw! oh man! uh, uh uh uh...
uh because! uh my parents are out of town, and i don't have a babysitter.
aaaaa!!
don't go anywhere. russell crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. 
they have to show it! they promised they would!
coming this summer! the greatest canadian duo of all time is back.
they were wearing cowboy hats!  did you see??  did you see?? 
oh, i'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
it looks even better than their first movie, huh?
who wants to tell him?
hehey, fellas. i'm glad you called me. there was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and i thought we should all go.
wuh well, sure. 
wull what is it?
well uh, it's my pleasure! i love bein' you guys' new friend.
not working out?
lame
huh but ah i thought we were gettin' along... great. heh ah i thought we were really havin' fun together.
we're sorry, butters.  our mind is made up.
hm, i think he took that pretty well, i think.
hu-uh, okay mom.  yes. uh sleet sleep for now.  tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
...what if we don't want to be your friend?
so today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  it was a really fun time. we rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
i think i deserve to take kenny's place the most, because, i've been hanging around these guys for like five years and i never get to say or do anything.
man, i really hope i win, because... wait... why is this again? i have no idea what's goin' on.
o! shut her down. someone needs assistance.
ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. i love bringing chaos!  and that's only the beginning! 
pip  jimmy  jason  towelie  luigi .
aaarr! 
timmay!
next?
sit down, boys.
just go, butters.  okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, eric?
five... times...  one.
five.
you're such a fatass, cartman!
oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.
okay, mom.  so. someone has discovered my horrible secret. this could be a trap set by the fbi. oh, i'll be at the docks, precious fbi! but it is i who'll have the trap set for you! come, my minions!  we haven't much time!
what?
oh boy! oh thank god! 
this whole thing is stupid! you don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
now let us go look for my minions!  they ran away here, now to find 'em... 
okay wait...  no, no wait. 
anything that'll impress us, token.
aaaah. oh, i know. 
eho! yes. can i have some tea, please?

okay, so how do we all feel about towelie as our new friend? 
you're right. well now, how about timmy?  he's quiet and he takes direction well.
how about token? 
so? you're a smartass!
hey fellas. i was just in the neighborhood and i thought i'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
yeah well, i guess i'll be seeing you, you friends later. 
well i had another idea of how to kill the world, but i thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
oh puh please. oh, oh god... please. 
oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
uh oh.
it's not?
no way.
nuh uh.
no way.
only sixteen dollars? they can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
aww, i don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the simpsons.  i have to think of something else.  uh goddamnit, how come every time i think of something clever, the simpsons already did it?
sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  yesss... yeesss...
"look at me, livin' free
free and clean amongst the sea people
''we look for pirates and search for gold.
life is an adventure with the sea people
they don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
they don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
this is the way life was meant to be. laughin' and singing,
sea people and me.
sea people and me, you guys."
woowww. only three more hours, sea people.  only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
ready. let's see 'em.
are they playing basketball? 
hey, these are brine shrimp. i used to feed them to my fish.
i told you, cartman.
what are we gonna do with them?
yeah, that'd be funny.
heheh, okay, okay.
jesus christ, we killed her!
oh jesus!  that's it, man! i want nothing more to do with you guys!
yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
wow, i guess this really is a big deal.
this is it.
"hammertime? can't the code word just be... ""lookout""? i won't remember ""hammertime""!"
dude, it's probably in her stomach. 
what do we do now?
do you see the sea people.
dwaah!!
alright, children, i got you four tickets to thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . it's gonna be tough living for a while. you might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
yes! that stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  i thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 
okay. goodnight, cartman. 
i'm so glad we're not murderers. 
ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
oh no, what now? 
wow. how did that happen?
they're like, bacteria. small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
hr!
well what are you gonna do?
can i help you?
your... mom told you?
we... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
frances velman.
everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  one donor, certified, on record.
what are you doing?
five? vials?
www-we don't have that much here.
soon they'll discover frozen food. goh-ho.
well, drop them in! 
wow. that's a lot of sea men you've got there, cartman.
that's cool.
okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
...close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
huh.
cartman?
ha ha! 
hey. we paid for the sea people too. how come they're not making statues of us? 
that is very impressive, eric. what do you intend to do with your underwater society?
aha! ahaha! ahahahaha!
they did that on the simpsons! ha! treehouse of horror! episode 4f02! the genesis tub. lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's god! ha! hahaha!
...yeah. so?
good for you!
me?? aw, man! i don't wanna be a god. that is waaay too much pressure.
gaaa-hah!
the sea people on tweek's side just suicide-bombed the cartman statue.
oh god-damnit! 
yep. but i guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
what are they talking about?
okay. and did father maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt? 
what would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
in your butts?
we don't know. we're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
calm down, tweek. there has to be a rational explanation.
what?
yeah.
cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
it wouldn't work!
i don't need to. it wouldn't work.
you're on, fat boy!
well, cartman?
well, go on, smartass, and do it!
you've had five, dude!
no! because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
get the fuck out of here!
gelgameks?
what?
well we have to try. our religion is dying!
harrr!
so?
go fuck yourself, cartman!
get up, fat boy! i'm gonna kick your ass!
the surgeon-general's response has made americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
to hell with the holy document of vatican law!! 
so?
cartman, there's something i need to tell you.
you were totally, one hundred percent right.
you won the bet. you were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and i've just been frustrated because i didn't think of it first. i want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... i'm... proud to have you as a friend.
aw, dude, why would they do that?
goddamnit, that pissed me off!
sorry, suckers! 
we have to do something. let's form a club.
no! nono, ah i don't wanna form a club! that's too much pressure! look, ah-i'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. and, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. commitments!
i'm not! i'm not a team player!
d'oh-ho! oh jesus!
well what's wrong with it?
"""free hat?"""
but we don't have hats!
aahh!
my center. my... center.  calm  cup? 
gaaaaah!
oh god!
a thousand?  oh jesus man! i don't have nearly a thousand hats!
oh god!
eh- excuse me?
if we go on nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
you?? why?
when did we do dibs for it?
alright, fine!  you're the spokesman, cartman! but you'd better not screw it up!
a new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from south park, colorado. the organization was created to protect hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. and also to free hat mccollough. so boys, i ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free hat mccollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?
you're here.
ah, i thought we were speaking for the children.
uh-look, if the beatles went back and updated their white album every few years, what would we have now?
how so?
members, this is our darkest hour. we've just learned that george lucas and steven spielberg now intend to update and change raiders of the lost ark.  there's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. mr. secretary? 
yeah!
hwaaah!
haaah!
i'm breaking into george lucas's house. i'm not breaking into george lucas's house. i'm in a green field.
that's it!
huh uh.
we're gonna make it better. the movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!
oh god, no! not plan b! 
...what??
waitwaitwaitwaitwait. i thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
"so we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song"
well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
that depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. all i want are my friends.
except for cartman - you can keep him.
yeah. i i think so.
yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. sometimes they matter... later. we have to care more about later sometimes, you know? i think that's what separates us from the steven spielbergs and george lucases of the world.
cartman likes to play with dolls?
oh please, mister. please let me out of here.
bark bark bark bark!
please, mister, let me out.
i miss my mom, mister. i wanna see my mommy-
sweetie.
you have to get ready for school
yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
you'll get over it, honey.
m'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  i know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
yeah. bebe is kinda cool, huh? 
i don't know. why?
yeah. i never noticed that before. maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
hellafun
oh yeah.
wwooww!
"""the new cold war"""
you... guys wanted me to meet you here?
oh god.
yep.
uh huh.
that would be best.
kyle??
me?? dude, i've been here since the beginning!
dude, we're not kicking kyle out!
no!
yeah!
sure thing, bebe.
cartman's?
precious?
uh huh. 
it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
mister, please let me out of here.
it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
my parents have money, mister. they'll give you whatever you want. please!
put the lotion in the basket!
don't you hurt my fucking dog!
what the hell are you doing?
oh my god. i get it now. it was bebe's boobs.
yes!
oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
it will.
so? i don't know him!
you relax! what if he wants to kill me?! aaaaaaaa!! 
i wouldn't worry about that.
you're such a fatass, cartman.
de bandig baeakhalah?
oh that's great!
okay! well i'll just need your ticket stub.
it was such a long time ago!
"sh-orry boys. no ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. if you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. that's called ""the ticking clock."" works great in the movies. "
which one of us took it?! it was so long ago, i c- i can't remember.
you hold on to this, cartman. i might lose it.
(okay.) 
his body? well, why??
yeah. closure.
here he is, boys. our dear little kenny. 
thang-thanks for coming by, boys. ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  aw now, honey. 
did you get it? 
let him out, cartman! 
i can't see. 
it wa a trick!
why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
goddamnit! there has to be a way! 
hurry up, kenny! you're gonna be late for school! 
cartman, come on!
kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from kenny!
oh good! cartman's back from the junkyard.
mr. garrison threw away his car?
cartman? cartman?!
dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
maybe you got brain cancer.
man, i can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
grandma??
no cloud city, not even a giant. heaven must still be a long way off.
huh?
what??
what does me being a jew have to do with anything?!
yes we do! just not the christian heaven!
haahh!!! 
(we can watch it at my house.)
(shut up, cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
(i said, shut up, cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
what did you say?!
dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
you're too fat to be kenny.
you see boys, kenny is in here.  what the???  wait a minute! this is kitty litter!
dude, don't you know what this means? you drank kenny!
you did, dude! you drank his whole body!
bad, eric, bad! 
yeah. good job, fatass! 
i can't live like this. i, i have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
can i help you?
you'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
it's gonna be okay, babe.
damnit! damnit!  thanks a lot, kid! 
eh! 
hold on to this, cartman. i might lose it. 
(okay!) 
you'd better not lose that ticket, kenny, or else i'll kick you in the nuts! the nuts! the nuts!
i assure you, i am not high.
what do you mean, fatass?
where??
do you see anything?
whoawhoawhoa! maybe kyle's right. we gotta spark the vision somehow.
do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
yeah. but what about kenny. his soul is still in cartman's body.
whoa.  kenny, you in there?
o great wizard of gregendath. what quest do you ask of this ranger and paladin?
yeah, whatever.
look out! here comes the great dragon of perengraph!
good job, wizard.
i'm a paladin, cartman!
well, thank you very much, kind heroes.
oh, but you are noble heroes. we know our thanks is enough. 
calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
quick! a monster of rivendell!
well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
woww.
but it's the greatest movie i have ever seen. you guys were right. lord of the rings is awesome. eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
my movie!  my awesome cool movie. my... precious.
yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
lord of the rings? ha! that movie's gay!
there's four of us! kenny's soul is still trapped in cartman's body!
dude, that video is making people act strange.
we can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
yeah. butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
precious.  let me see my precious.  plee-ee-ee-ease! 
yes, but this is not a--  wow, twelve hours? ...yes, but this is not a normal copy. it's making people act really strange. 
very well, i shall call the council together. meet me in the woods of gathering behind talangar the black's house. and don't let my mom see you, 'cause i'll get in trouble.
faragon, asshole! 
perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. 
boys, we're not mad at you. we just wanna talk to you. 
i don't know, i don't wanna know. i'm out. 
you're too young.
you guys, this is stupid.
no, no, there's seven of us. kenny's soul is still trapped in cartman's body, remember?
we were almost killed.
ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
we're playing harry potter.
you guys. somebody is following us.
butters?
the precious videotape. l-let the butters see it.
hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
they're gonna take the lord of the rings from us.
what? that's stupid.
me too. 
yeah. good job, wizard fat ass! now we're totally lost.
no, butters. look what it's done to you. it's made you even lamer than before.
don't let them turn it back into the video store!
you stupid little fourth graders!
crap! parents!  come on, guys.  we'll see you next time, fourthies!
ugh.
eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist russia. 
now, stalin was a big silly when it came to...
eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
welcome to the museum of tolerance. here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in america. 
queer. beaner. chink. nigger. heeb. faggot. cracker. slope. 
now you know how it feels.
"that's right. not all stereotypes are negative. but even a positive one like ""all asians are good at math"" is harmful to society."
this is our discovery wing. take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here.
but you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. if he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.
and we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
you children just take your lunches. i'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
you don't need three lunches, eric! you're fat enough as it is!
vhat?  waht?!
vhat is in there?
get back to verk.
eww! eww! eww! 
not sure. it looks like a possible code five six!
it's going to be okay, baby. we're going to get you more time.
yes, but his time is still getting weaker. it will give out soon unless we do something. 
no, that's kenny.
oh my god! eric, how long have you been channelin' kenny?
kenny? kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
weak!
uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. it doesn't work that way. uh, okay, i i'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. it's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-.
oh well. good luck getting kenny out of you, fatso.
you are so a douche! i'm nominating you for the biggest douche in the universe award, you douche!  son of a bitch. 
welcome aboard scotland air. our trip to edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
in the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.
rob schneider is a carrot. rated pg-13.
alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
na kamaa karash meh nah- 
in the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!
well i'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. should last a few months in the freezer. 
well i don't know. how did edward know my father died in march?
i thought you got it.
it's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. touching it won't hurt you.
whoa, kyle and cartman! it's so cool to see you guys.
wow. that's pretty cool.
'cause, r-tard, he's stan from the future. he knows everything stan knows.
shut up, cartman!
oh, i don't know. you guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. i just lost touch with you after i was sent to juvi hall in 2006.
uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
cartman??
what the hell are you doing here?!
god-damnit, i knew this was too good to be true! come on, butters, let's go. 
oh, sorry. i thought this was a legitimate business!
how many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! it was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
yeah!
how much is this going to cost us?
well i think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
hwuhh. that'll make them awful sore.
poop- poop swatches?
hey, that's neato, huh, stan?
wow, eh eh you sure are a p-professional, eric! i don't know which swatch i like best.
well that sounds good.
hooray!
yeah.
yeah.
yeah!
that's not neato, that sucks.
you're gonna smear butters' parent's walls with poop. i thought his revenge was unique and customized!
dude, that's not extreme enough! my parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! i want them to see what they did was wrong! i want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
dude!
no, that's too extreme!
just forget it, cartman! you don't know what you're doing! 
right. 
¿qué? ¿la caca no esta aquí? 
¡sí, sí señor! 
sí. marrado. 
sí. 
boy, it sure is stinky in here!
look, eh, eric, i've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and i don't think-
looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh stan?
uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
well here, eric, i baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
atta boy, eric. you've made the right choice.
haha, it's me, cartman! you from the future.  i came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. you stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become ceo of your own time-travel company!
right on!
av-a-a-alright, i'm done.
ye-yes, i-i've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
it doesn't look good, eric. it doesn't look good.
a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe santa three hundred and six presents.
four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
"yes, wa-a-i didn't think ""hitting clyde in the balls with slingshot"" really counted as nice."
ye you can't deduct things like that, eric. santa will know and then he'll come after you.
hey hey,  i'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! don't blame me for the numbers!
but what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
if you cure cancer... and aids next week, you would still owe two presents.
hooray!! christmas tree! christmas tree!  christmas tree!
what are you doing, cartman?
yeah! christmas tree! christmas tree!
what's it?
oh no. 
cartman, why are you doing this?
mr. hankey! 
cartman is trying to bring christmas to iraq.
well, gosh, eric, looks like you really have the christmas spirit!  i know someone who can help. santa claus!
oh, that's no problem! we just need a little christmas magic.  all aboard the poo choo express!
next stop, the north pole!
me neither.
all the way and back!
god, it took forever!
i was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
oh no, they keep it open until midnight of christmas eve. some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this christmas. tell him, eric.
you know you're right. santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. perhaps santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
and you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
jesus christ, they killed him!
oh no.
what the hell are we supposed to do?! we're like nine inches tall!
is that what this is all about?!  you came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
well good going, asshole! thanks to you, there's not gonna be any christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
here it is. red sleigh 2. 
you just have to call out the reindeer's names.
no, no, they're all dead. you have to call out the new ones.  on steven, on fluffy, on horace, on chantel. on skippy, on rainbow, on patches, on montel.  good luck finding jesus! 
we should be able to find jesus in no time!
what are you doing?
singing a christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, cartman! don't forget: it's because of you that santa's sleigh got shot down!
all i'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
hooowdy ho! 
you're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! 
my children, you should know something.  i'm packing.  let's go! 
on skippy, on rainbow, on patches, on montel. 
oh shut up, cartman! your sweet christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
wow! look, you guys! santa got us all haibo dolls! 
cartman, i thought all you wanted was a haibo doll!
ah, damn it!
no, ike! you can't come to school with me. 
dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
waaaah--  ow.
whoa cartman. looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
really? what about?
totally!
that wasn't a dream cartman, those were visitors!
yeah. this does seem really familiar.
cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
no, dude, this happened before! aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! you don't remember that?
you don't?
cartman was visited by aliens again last night. and now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
other than his monstrous size.
all right, let's see here.  oh my god!!
why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! 
all right, let's take a look. 
and afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
well the prostate seems to be normal. no swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
are you okay?
i've never quite seen this before, uh... perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.
you all right?
someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
no way!  you do it, kenny!
kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
god-damnit cartman!
stop it cartman!
god dammit!
(derrr!)
eric, that's enough!
oh, nice going, cartman!
no!
it stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! let's just get this over with!
can i see this thing, please?
okay. now it's funny again.
where is the signal being sent to? 
what do we do???
hold on, children!  we have to ditch them! 
that ain't no police! 
we're in the alien ship.
it's not helen hunt's ass. it's an alien space ship.
(awesome)
yeah, that's like that stupid movie, contact.
how's this? 
no.  no! 
all right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? 
why?? because you're playing with people's lives! you're turning people's problems into entertainment!
you must have some joozian ancestry.
oh god, we did suck each other's jagons! you kids won't tell anybody about this, right??
i'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
well, we've got a five o'clock with the yurka producers.  nice meeting you earthlings. bye! 
whoa cartman. looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
chef, kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
say, fellas! thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! 
in the coming days  i will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle.
that's nice, guys. we're just gonna stay out of this one. 
sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
hey timmy. how many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? one.  you know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? whatever his name is. 
cartman, just stay out of it.
okay. good, children, good. remember to feel the clay. be one with the clay. nice. uh huh. 
you know, i've had it! you four boys never take art class seriously!
do you think this is funny?!  do you think this is funny, huh?!  well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! 
i certainly can! i'm your teacher!
(yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
like what?
tp her house?
oh.
fine! but we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
d'you think that's enough?
don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? we should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
hello boys. find everything you need?
mokay, let's see here. toilet paper  toilet paper  toilet paper  toilet paper  toilet paper  so, what are you kids up to tonight? 
okay. toilet paper  toilet paper  tooilet paper  you know, son, i rmember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. 
you tp'ed a house last week, cartman?
is this the right house?
oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
we didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
(yeah! fuck you!)
we're, we're in trouble. we're in sooo much trouble.
how can you say that? did you see what we did to their house?! it'll take them days to clean that up!
well, you don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, cartman!
yeah. they say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
i don't know. i don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
okay children, let's take our seats. oh, uh, stan, kyle, eric, and kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
how the hell did they find out it was us that tp'ed that house?
we'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
yes, dude!
ah, ah i, ah i thought...
look, kyle, just let cartman do all the talking, okay? he's better at being in trouble than anybody.
come on, kenny, let's go, 'k? 
why are they doing us one at a time?
i can get a better deal?
oh god! oh god! i have to tell the truth!  mooooomm! 
i was... i was just going to get a drink of water.
oh. okay. thanks.
noo, i'll just... be... going back to bed now.
thank you. your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.
what about him?
(i think so too.)
butters. 
so what should we do?
(yeah!)
kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
what's this all about, cartman?
a boat ride?
well, okay.
terrible. every time i close my eyes i see the house we tp'ed. i see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
i don't know what to do.  part of me feels like i wanna end it all now.  tell people what heppened. you know, i never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  so cold. the world can feel like that.  so calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  ow.  what the hell are you doing, cartman?!
cartman!
you wanna kill me?! fine!  i can't live like this anymore! go ahead! do it! 
cartman, what are you doing?
you don't have to kill kyle, dude. the police made an arrest. and the person confessed!
who confessed? that doesn't make any sense.
it sure is!
you guys, we can't let him do this!
because it was-
all right, boys, visiting time is over. thanks for stopping by.
i still feel bad, cartman
yeah. that makes it even worse.
i know.
he feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
(yeah, maybe we should.)
we feel bad for other people.
tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  and cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
officer, can i stay in jail, please?
what is it, cartmam? 
it's over this way! come on!
cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
you can't kill all three of us, cartman!
you, you do? how?
cartman??
luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
yeah. but i have to say, i feel a lot better now.
oh jesus! 
you just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
oh, stop it, cartman! you didn't learn anything! not a god-damned thing!
okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
yeah.  war is not my voice.
boys, what do you think the founding fathers would say?
shut up! i want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the founding fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's fs for you! 
oh no you don't, cartman! every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
you're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
shut up and study!
what are you doing?
(a what?)
no, you just have to study.
just face it, cartman. you're gonna have to study!
cartman, what the hell are you doing?! you're suppsoed to be studying! 
how?!
cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
cartman? cartman?? 
no, turdpants, it's kyle!
cartman? you'd better be studying, god-damnit! 
oh no...
cartman, you're supposed to be studying! what the hell is all this?!
uh cartman, i think that's a really bad idea.
your tivo is full.
aww crap.
worthy young lad, are you all right?
this year? why it's 1776, it is.
would you like a ride into town? i'm on my way to master thomas jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, i am.

rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble!  oh my, it's benjamin franklin. it's benjamin franklin. it's benjamin franklin.

and that is my presentation on latinos in the arts. thank you. 
it isn't fair. i spent weeks preparing my speech on latino culture.
no you didn't, asshole! what you did was totally stupid and racist! and you only did it to screw me over!
awww, i don't think kyle likes you, ms. lopez.
ms. lopez, do you like kyle?
ms. lopez, would you like to give kyle a kiss?
stop it!
stop wasting the tacos on your hand, cartman!
nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, cartman!
look, we're not going in there, so just-! wait, why the hell am i talking to your hand?  look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
cartman, will you stop this gayness?!

okay, ms. lopez, time to go to sleep.

...what?
what are you gloating about?
no!
holy smokes, it's jennifer lopez!
who was that?!  you go' a problem?!
that? that's what replaced me?!
i'm sure it was just a mistake.
you fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!
fuck you! 
you'd better stop!
well, there you go, fatass! i hope you learned your lesson.
aw, god-dammit!
gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit.
what the hell are you doing?
look, we spent all night at the recording studio. now it's time to sleep!
sleep!
sleep!
what's the matter, sweetie?
ms. lopez won't go to sleep!
hey, i was wondering if i could talk to ms. lopez.
will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
no!
i'm not going out in his car.
i don't care. i'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
jenny, can i kiss you?
no!
oh god, jenny!
you little snot-nose!  you ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! 
you'd better stay away from him! 
"oh dear.
dr. doctor:
but i'm more concerned about his state of mind. your son appears to be completely insane."
cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
come on, sweetie. doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
what is it, sweetie?
good morning, baby.
you have to get out of here! jennifer lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
should we tell him the news?
it's s'aright?
we're getting married!!
come in.  come in!! 
what's the matter?
so stop doing it!
you know god-damn well what! now get outta here!
see?! i just saw your lips move!
cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
okay, okay, i know that i control everything ms. lopez does.
out! 
dude, who the hell is mitch connor?
all right.  all right, i guess it's possible.
yes?  oh, hello, boys.
i'll do that. have fun, boys. 
yes. two days ago i put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  and later, when i went to get it, it was gone.
we're on the case.
detective mccormick found something interesting. 
your husband.  he wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
his plan was to use a hammer.
then saw off the arms and legs. 
the arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
but before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
we're in business!
i lost my dolly.
put that away, dude! 
don't worry, ma'am. we'll find your doll.
disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. he would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
...not anymore, you're not!
son of a bitch stupid fbi!
we're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
right. i think i know exactly where to start.
ah, i was at home.
they've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
(aw, now don't say that. poor little kid.)
well i don't have nothin' to confess. honestly.
how do i do that?
well how do i make semen... come out of my body?
i'm not playing. i really don't know!
how... do you make semen come out?
it's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
no!
(aw, it's okay, kid. it's not going to hurt.) 
my weiner??

...ow... ow... it's not workin'
ow. ow. ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. naw, nothin'
nooooo!
cartman! cartman! we just got a tip that a doll was found near fosse's house!
yeah, that's gay. 
what?  what??
i don't know.
dude, we just can't tell on them.
we've got to do something.
hey, you buttholes can't play fbi here!
no you're not.
we're not playing dungeons and dragons, assface!
my dollie! 
that means you boys are now an official part of the department.
relax, hopkins!  all fun and games, right?  soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??
dude, i don't wanna play detective anymore.
i wasn't. we started playing detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. or have you forgotten why you joined the force, kyle?
you guys can go back to playing laundromat owners if you want, but... i'm not gonna give those kids playing the fbi a chance to laugh at us. see you guys at school tomorrow.
eric, where have you been? it's ten thirty.
well you should've called mommy.
well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and i'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
who-o-o-o-a. oowwww!
yes?
well i'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.
oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. they found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in colorado.
these kids are cops, man! 
(pakew! pakew!)
certainly.
fellas! hehey fellas! i got it! ah i got my semen sample!
that's great, butters, but we're not playing detective anymore. we're playing laundromat owners.
wow, dude.
welcome to the three feathers casino. i'm your host, chief runs with premise. please try your luck at one of our many games.
halt.  i am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
oh, you heard him, sheila! kyle wants to leave! our nice old house doesn't interest kyle anymore! well i'm calling the moving company right now! 
how can they do that, huh? how can they make us all move away?
yeah!
we just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
oh... 
we can stay. and fight.
oh sure. until the native americans decide they want that land, too! what if the native americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? we have to stand up to them now!  rrrgh! forget it! come on, you guys! 
oh my god, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
so, i'm watching the season premiere of boy meets boy on television, and then queer eye for the straight guy comes on, right? so i fall asleep in front of the tv, and when i wake up, i see that i've spilled the coke i was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
hey dudes. 
what?
you've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
oohh my god, you got splotches on your neck. are you using any exfoliating products at all??
dude, i can't wait for wendy to see how gay i look!
not as gay as us, though.
oh yeah?! we're super duper triple-dog gay!
maybe. but you'll never be as metrosexual as us! come on, fags! 
you're straight!
what the hell is going on??
i'm not just gay, i'm a catamite. 
oh, stop it!! you kids don't even know what you're talking about!! eric, you're not half-bi!!
one of you?!  we've spent our whole lives tryin' not to be one of you! you can't do this to us!!
wow, is that from origins?
hey guys. you wanna throw the football around?
well, what can we do about it?
what?? that's stupid. we wouldn't have to kill kyle! we would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
yeah. wait, what?
oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
wow, we look great!
yeah mom! we're proud of who we are.
aw jesus, kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! come play catch with us. 
god-damnit!
ooohhh, i thought a group of vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
i think out band better buy a whole bunch of music cds to listen to for inspiration.
christian rock?!
that's a retarded idea, cartman!
i don't wanna be in a stupid christian rock band!
just get the hell out of here, cartman! you're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
you're on, fat boy!
what a stupid asshole!
oh, hi eric.
...ohhh!
what?! we don't have a bass guitar.
whoa, you sure seem with it, eric. you must have some... ih-inspiration.
hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.
so, what are we doing?
wow!
i'm out. 
two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
i don't know!
i don't know how to play bass. 
i'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
god-damnit! 
man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... i fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.
why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
this christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
what did you say?! 
cheese!
cheese!
oh...
why the hell would i be looking way over there??
tom, i'm standing in south park, colorado, where the rock band, moop, has refused to play. the strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.
we're not letting you back in the band, cartman! fuck off!
it is?? 
you get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
yeah, you don't even know anything about christianity.
leather-bound bibles. show your faith.
oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. they need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.
huh we're not really christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
"the shepherd and the light, and his word lifted me up
and i praise his holy name wherever i go."
hey is this the way to the backstage?
yeah. we proved that christian music can be tough and hard core.
sent down from heaven! the spirit and the glory!
always good to be praying before you're playin'.
uh. uh apparently there's been a change. give it up for ... faith + 1! 
guys, we here at faith records were very moved by your performance at christfest. you're one of the most talented christian rock bands we've ever heard!
"we just have one question, though. we were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... ""i want to walk hand-in-hand with jesus on a private beach for two./i want him to nibble on my ear and say 'i'm here for you.'"" ih...it seems you really love christ."
eh no but ih it appears you are actually... in love with christ. 
well uh of course i do. i mean i just-
uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for god, and not for the money.
k-tal records  presents the most inspirational christian rock band in the world! faith + 1,  featuring the very best in good, wholesome christian music.
"with great inspirational songs like ""i wasn't born again yesterday,"""
the cd is filled with instant classics. who doesn't remember... 
"i don't have a choice, dude. i'm gonna swallow my pride, face cartman, and say ""congratulations. you were right"" and i'm gonna give him the ten dollars. and hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it."
cartman, what the hell is all this?
but you spent all the money we made!
let's just get this over with, cartman. you won the bet, here's ten dollars.
we like to praise christ!
this is the worst day of my life.
boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the christian recording industry is please to present you with this myrrh album. 
ha! our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! i don't owe you anything, fat boy!
no, but you can go double myrrh. 
oh, please don't take the lord's name in vain.
but you spread the word of the lord. you've brought faith in jesus.
yeah. you're gonna hurt the band.
good job, dickhead! you lost the entire audience!
friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. 
you insensitive asshole, cartman! nine people died!
oh my god!! 
it isn't fair. cartman's fatter than the goal.
i think so.
gaaaaah!!
oh jesus!
come on! 
in here! 
yeah...
well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
blue impala, pull your vehicle over!
"and so you see, children, genghis khan was a ""mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, nicholas cage. okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  that's odd.  those rotc guys are way off course. "
uh, can i help you folks find something?  oowww! 
all right, check it out. kenny did reconnaissance on the town. the old people have blockades here  and here . the old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the mayor's office.
we can't fight them, cartman.
country kitchen buffet?
that's a retarded idea, cartman!
ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
i think i have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  we'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  at 5:45 kenny and kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  meanwhile, stan and i sneak into the mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the country kitchen buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to kyle's chest. we say our tearful goodbyes to kyle, and then we send him inside. 
(woohoo!)
...yeah, or we just go to country kitchen buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
dude, i wonder where kyle is.
(yeah.)
you guys! you guys! i have awesome news!
no. this saturday, for my birthday, my mom says she's takin' me to casa bonita, in denver, and i get to invite three friends!.
what's casa bonita?
it's like the disneyland of mexican restaurants.
who said i'm inviting you? 
yes. three friends. you're not my friend.
i'm gonna take butters. he invited me to his birthday party last month, so i owe him one.
because butters isn't a total dick to me!
oh please! all you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being jewish!
"oh yeah?! well you're a stupid jew! you're a jew! shut your god-damned jew mouth! good job, jew! jew... shut up, jew! you're jewish!! dude, he's jewish! jew! jew! jew! jew! jew! jew! jew?! ""i told you jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""fuck off, cartman!"""
you've always been a dick to me, cartman, and i'm not inviting you. 
sorry, my mind's made up.
i'm not inviting you to casa bonita.
well fuck you, kyle!! i hope you die! i hope you fucking die!! 
i'm not inviting you, cartman. you can't go.
no! noooo!  casa bonita! noooo!  aaaah!!  oh... god-damnit, i have to get invited to go! i'm just gonna have to start being nice to kyle!
that isn't it, cartman.
that's not being nice! that's just putting on a nice sweater!
i know you don't. 
well, sure, eric. w-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
well, the best thing is not to act nice, eric. uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
well, eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. the best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
well, like, try this one on for size: knock knock.
"ing-mar ...bergman.  now you say, ""ingmar bergman who?"" "
do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
(yeah!) 
well?
how are you going to try to get invited to casa bonita this time?
oh. well... yeah. i, i did.
i'm still not inviting you to casa bonita.
eh... hey, cartman?  you really don't care that you can't go?
that's exactly what i wanted to hear from you all along. ah uh i still have to take butters, but... i hope things can be cool too.
and, and hey, if for some reason butters can't go to casa bonita, you can take his place.
what's this all about, eric?
well, sure i can!
nnn-how terrible?
what?? 
i just see stars. 
nope, uh i don't see any...  oh wait. oh my god! i see it. i see it! it's a meteor! oh my god!
it is! it is getting closer! oh my god!
when do you think uh it'll get here?
what??
oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
wha...? where is there a bomb shelter??
oh jeez!
oh god! oh jesus! 
but what about everyone else? i have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
are you sure?
but i'm the only one down here. what am i supposed to repopulate with?
yeah, screw him. let's go.  oh, finally! 
oh. thanks, dude.
oh wait. cartman.
uh butters didn't show. you wanna go to casa bonita with us?
i told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. you in?
okay, boys. get in the car.
aw dude, weak.
yeah, it's kinda weird.
that's very good of you, boys. we can postpone casa bonita until next saturday.
i'll drive you boys. 
"""dried food rations. add water to feed flavored square...""  hello?  hello??"
hwaaaah!!
wuh, wait, well, what happened??
what about my parents. did you see them?
oh my god, let me see!
how many survivors are there? you should all come down here.
wow... eric, i can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
all right, folks. i wanna thank you for all your efforts. three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. it is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. 
i say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. let's move out, people! every second counts! 
but if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. eh,oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- eric?  eric, is that you?
who's coming this way?
oh god! i hate cannibals!
noooo!
but i can't see nothin'.
are we out in the destruction?
aw man.
all right, this way, butters. just follow the sound of my voice. 
huh... oh, it's terrible.
whoa!
whaaat??
aaaahh!
waaaaaah!
ooohhhh!
ooooh, what happened? what happened?!
oh no!
uh w-where??
aren't you coming?
eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. i... i love you.
i love you too, man. i just  you look so delicious! must eat your brains! 
finally i can breathe a-  oh my god. oh my god, the meteor took out everything! it's all destroyed. nothing left.  hello? are there any, are there any other survivors? hello? oh. that must have been where the library was. and that was probably the school. hello?  oh. i forgot, i gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  is that a cannibal? sir? ma'am?  oh. aww, it's a little dog.  well, hello there, mr. dog. looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. we should stick together, huh, mr. dog? well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
yeah, it's pretty cool.
dude, it's kyle's birthday. we should do whatever he wants to do.
what? fuck kyle.  ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. of course we'll do whatever kyle wants, uh. happy birthday, kyle.
oh...  ma'am, can i use your phone?
eric, the south park police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
i should have known better! you never cared about my birthday at all!
cartman, stop it!
it's too late, fatass.  they'll be here in less than a minute.
cartman!
all right, kid! end of the line!
well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to juvenile hall for a week! huh, was it worth it?
hey. my name's gary.
dude, that new kid is such a douche!
he's a peckerface, that's what he is!
wull, maybe he won't fight.
all right, i'm gonna go kick his ass. 
what are they doing?
he's a really nice kid.
all right, that does it. from now on, our family is mormon!
shut up, dude. they're a nice family and... gary is actually really smart and talented.
hey stan.
wow, you made this?
hey, just what the heck am i supposed to be? 
so what do you guys wanna do?
oh cool! i'm gonna do that tomorrow.
i'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
oh brother.
look, maybe us mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe joseph smith did make it all up, but i have a great life. and a great family, and i have the book of mormon to thank for that. the truth is, i don't care if joseph smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. and even though people in this town might think that's stupid, i still choose to believe in it. all i ever did was try to be your friend, stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. you've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. suck my balls. 
dude, this is unbearable.
woohoo! 
aw dude, this is really hard.
boys, what are you doing back here?  i asked you a question: what are you doing back here, 'k?!
what??
d'awww sick! 
well hey, if i didn't know any better, i'd think you boys have been smoking!
well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? you're grounded for three weeks!
no matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
hwat??
well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? it's been happening a lot lately. how about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
alright kids, here's what we're gonna do.  we're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper.  once you're inside, mm, mm, i'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. got it?
yuh your vacation house in mexico, then, whatever it is! look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! and i'm not gonna tolerate it! i will end smoking in bars in colorado! there will be no more smoking here!
what??
all right boys, just do what i tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars!  as soon as we get into the main facility, i'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! think you can handle it?
that's right. over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from africa to help work the fields.
this is how we get rid of smokers.  we go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!
you kids need to understand something, okay? sometimes lying is okay. like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.
well they want proof?! all right, we'll give them proof! boys, i need one of you to act in a commercial for us! we'll shoot it tomorrow!
and you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. all right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in potsdam! let's go!
yeah, maybe you're right. 
go ahead. we don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
no, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
"sure you don't, kyle. oh, and neither do i. oh, i know what you're gonna say next. you're gonna say, ""how about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" and then i'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. that's serbian jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. the game... is on. "
what are you doing? 
cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. but i'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
okay eric, this is going to be real simple. all you gotta do is read the words on the teleprompter here. 
let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  all right, roll camera. roll the teleprompter. and whenever you're ready, eric.
and cut! great! we got it! wrap it up, people. that was fantastic.
that was very good, eric. here, eat this cupcake.
but you are. just eat this one cupcake. it has... sprinkles.
eric, do you know what a hero is? a hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. you can be a hero, eric. all you have to do... is eat the cupcake. 
what are you doing, cartman?
who's going to kill you?
yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
no dude, get away!
stop it, cartman! go die on your own!
don't be ridiculous, boys. the anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
yeah! go to the tobacco company yourself!
(uh huh.)
i'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!
you too, eric.
"all right, you guys, it's first down. i'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" kyle and cartman, go deep post out. kenny, run a slant down the middle. butters, be ready for the screen."
football.
she just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. she said she still wants to be friends. 
oh yeah? well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
god, you're so stupid! 
yeah! like stan gives a crap if wendy breaks up!  stan? 
why? what's the point of living when the only girl i ever loved is gone?
this place is awesome!
so what can i get you?
ymca...  ymca-a.
oh! kyle, appealing to the prime minister of canada would take... time and money we don't have.
it's been a week since ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. i have to try to go to canada and speak with the new canadian prime minister, but i can't do it alone.
please, you guys, you don't understand.  my family is devastated. my mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
dude, cartman.
dude, we just can't up and go to canada. look, they're about to light the christmas tree. maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
the broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new canadian prime minister. what if this christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the broflovskis?
that's a great idea, chef.
then it's settled: this year we'll give all our christmas money to the broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
no! no, this can't be happening! 
what?
whoa whoa, cartman.
it's true, dude. christmas is ruined.
i'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. we can go to canada and see the prime minister like i said. if we can change his mind before christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
we'll get back in time for a christmas adventure.
hehehehe, never try to barter with a chinese man.
herro, welcome shitty airrine. 
you're not gonna die, kenny. don't be stupid.
no, you're both coming. do you care about christmas or not?
of course i care about christmas- doh, christ on a stick! 
all right! we're going to canada!
i'm trying! 
his brother is our quest. the question is, is what? you must talk to the new prime minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
oh that's easy. you just have to follow the road.
good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
baaaah.
power-hungry americans! i'll fix you!
it reminds me of death and fear.
oh no!
is it working?
do you think we can still make it in time?
ze prime minister is inside.
then that's it. i'm... i'm never going to get my brother back. 
oh please! please stop crying.
what is that?
wull yeah, but ah-i got my brother back.
dude, come on.
stop it, cartman!
dude! we should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. they'll never know what we bought.  i'll get the tonfas.  those are so sweet.
okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. i, i can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. 
we, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
kaii yo! 
(unintelligible)
all right, ninjas! let's go protect the world!
kick ass! 
no dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. our parents'll find out we have them.
you don't know anything about jews, fatass!
don't worry, kyle. craig's not gonna tell on us. come, ninjas, let's go.  all right, this is it.
ninja positions!  hello, craig!
we can't tell you where we got 'em! it's secret ninja stuff.
but don't tell anybody we have them.
uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
ho! 
hey fellas. what's happenin'?
wowee! hey, can i play, ninjas with you?
yeah, butters. you wouldn't make a very good ninja. come on, guys.  we have a lot of work to do.
okay, hang on guys. i'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
no asshole! from now on you only get to have one power! so what is it?!
yeah, that it, cartman! you don't get to have any powers!
whoa.
nuh uh! because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
huh nice attempt, ninja! but now both of you shall feel the power of my web of holding!  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! you are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
god dammit cartman!
(yeah! take this, professor chaos!)  (feel my wrath!) 
okay okay, calm down, butters! it'll be okay! 
stop dude! you're gonna scramble his brain!
god? please, if you get me out of this, i swear, i will never play with weapons ever again.
whoa, i'm getting woozy.
we... need a doctor... but we can't go to the hospital. wait a minute. wait, wait, wait. what about the veterinarian?
he's really old and going blind.
all right, then you take him to the hospital, kyle. you take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
we need some more fur.  i think that's good.
okay, it's clear. 
quick, hide butters! 
aha!  there you are! you guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! well look at what we got! 
at first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
then fight us!
oh no. butters!
stuck in his eye? was he bleeding?
to hell with that!
butters!
bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- butters!
butters!
dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
we don't have time for that, dude! we just have to ditch them! now!
screw you, fatass! 
we have to get past them!
you have that power too?
what?
you see the damage you've caused, eric cartman?! what were you thinking?!
yeah! 
say fellas, jimmy and i were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next s-s-saturday. we're both competing in the special olympics down in denver.
they're olympic games for handicapped people.
timmy! 
...you're an asshole, cartman.
oh, whatever you say, jimmy my friend.  whatever you say. 
what?
so?
oh no. cartman, no!
that's really, really terrible, dude.
cartman! i will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the special olympics!
because! 
what are you gonna do, kyle?! tell on me?!  then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  is that really how you deal with your problems?! grow up, kyle!  all i have to do is make people think i'm handicapped, and i get a thousand dollars. it won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
okay, then. 
god damn you!
no you're not!  i read the brochure, cartman! if you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the special olympics.
"it says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! "
yes, hon? 
what's that, hon?
"oh... n- no, sweetie. i believe those olympics are just for... ""special"" children."
you are, hon, but... i don't think that's a very good idea. 
...i'm sorry, eric. the answer is no. 
oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, i- i'll take you tomorrow.
okay, next in line please?
hello. um, i would like to... sign my son up, please.
eric cartman...
ohhh, oh. i'm not sure.  sweetie, what is your condition?
haaaaaaaaaah!
cartman, i really, really have a problem with what you're doing. i object to it morally, and i find it grossly offensive. 
i know that i often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time i think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, i believe you will go to hell. so i feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
i didn't come here to talk about the passion, cartman!
i came here to talk about you!
top athlete, yeah! '
okay, racers, are we ready?  take your marks.
on your marks! get set! go! 
we did it!
he's got it! that's a new special olympics record, folks! 
winner, jimmy valmer! 
all right, this one i can win!  here, hold this!  i'll show you goddamned retards! 
congratulations, jimmy. but we all know that the special olympics isn't just about winning. and so, we will now give out the spirit award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. eric cartman!
for winning the spirit award, eric will receive this gift certificate to shakey's for fifty dollars! come on up, eric!
hey! just what the hell do you think you're doing, eric?! '
hey kid. good for you for being honest.
well guys, i guess now you see what i was up to all along. i dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the special olympics on purpose, so that jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  eh, oh yeah?! we- well you guys are assholes!  grow up! 
warp drive disengaged. landing sequence initiated.
i'm a vulcan!
the atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
no! i'm on the away team too! 
i don't care! you're not making me wait in the van again!
fine, kyle! but if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
things seem pretty quiet.
i am picking up carbon-based life forms in sector c. i believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
no it doesn't. 
no i'm not! god damn it cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
oh god, here we go again.
he does not!
naw uh!
i'm not arguing about the passion! he's being an asshole!
people don't hate the jews!
...you're a stupid asshole! 
hey terrance, i think i have a-
wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 
hey phillip, guess what?
you were right. you were right all along. i thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on jews, but... i didn't know, i... i didn't know.
you were, you were right?
you were right. 
"okay, search for mel gibson. mel gibson bio, mel gibson news, mel gibson... home page. here we go.  welcome to mel gibson's thepassion.com, your source for everything mel. pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. damn it, no phone number! oh wait! ""for more information on mel gibson, call the webmaster at 1-800-43.."" okay, okay, wait, here we go. "
hi, uh, my friend and i just went to see the passion.
no, no, no, no, we want our money back.
we think the movie sucked and we want mel gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. do you know how we can get in touch with him?
look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with mel gibson so we can get our money back!
hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! i'll kick your ass!
i don't care! you sound like a little bitch to me!
yeah?! you wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
wait a minute. cartman?! 
eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
oh, that's great, sweetie.
okay, hon.
it's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use the passion to enrich everyone's lives. 
we sure do. 
i'm not sure, but- uh.  folks, i just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. the passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe mel gibson and this little boy our thanks. 
heheh, great! yeah! great idea.
k'plagh! k'plagh! and good evening, frieeeeeeends!
good idea!
what was our aramaic line again?
wir müssen die juden ausrotten.
oh, this is fun! 
wir müssen die juden ausrotten.
wir müssen die juden ausrotten.
wir müssen die juden ausrotten!
wir müssen die juden ausrotten!
wir müssen die juden ausrotten! 
no, no, no! don't become an angry mob!  the last time we did that we killed jesus!

yeah. lots of people got crucified in those times. we shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
woohoohoo! woohoohoohoohoo! 
all right stan!
(woohoo!)
that's right!
you did it, son! you did it!
"what the heck?  whoa! what a huge package!  ""to butters stotch.""  oh boy! it's for me! it's for me!  who is it from? ""sent from: japan. konichi-wa.""  wow! a package for me from japan!!  wow, what can it be? my birthday isn't until september 11.  oh boy! i've never gotten a package this big! i've always wanted to have a huge package. "
whoa...
you... you're my robot?
yep. that's right. he's a real live robot. he can walk and talk and everything. you're like the fourth kid i told already.  well i gotta go dougie. my robot and i have stuff to do.  heheh, they're all so jealous!  i'm so glad you came into my life, awesom-o. you're the best friend a guy could have.
hey yeah! well, i can tell you anything, huh?  well lessee... well, for one, i have what's called a hesiated colon, which means i sometime can't control my sphincter.
well, nobody knows it, but sometimes i poop my pants, so i have to wear a diaper to school.  you okay, awesom-o?
well, i have to take medicine for it every day. it's a little suppository i have to... put up my rectum.
hm, okay. let's see  oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes i get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is eric cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
yeah. one time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
yeah. and then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
no, he's not smart! he's just an asshole. and he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'cause what cartman doesn't know is that i know one of his secrets!
when cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like britney spears and pretend he's her! he sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of justin timberlake.
yeah! and i videotaped him doing it!
i've got the whole thing on tape! even him making out with the justin timberlake cutout!
yeah! and if cartman ever messes with me again, i'm gonna show that video to everybody! then i'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
huh? oh, i dunno. it's around here somewhere. hey! so what do you wanna do now, awesom-o?
how come?
oh, that's all right, awesom-o. come on! i have a lot of things to teach you. 
that's okay with your mom, mr. robot?
"i love to brush my teeth! in the mornin' and at night!
to keep 'em white and healthy, i got to brush them all the time!"
oh. yeah.
awww, you don't need to do that, awesom-o. hey, i gotta put in my suppository.  can you help me?
remember i said i put that medicinal suppository in my anus? it'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
haw, it's real easy. i'll show you. you just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and i'll, i'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
awesom-o, i though you were programmed to do whatever i tell you.
ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. get it up there good and deep.
all right awesom-o, time for us to get some sleep.  hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
oh, o-o-all right awesom-o. let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
awesom-o?!
awesom-o, what the sam heck are you doing?
aw jeez, jeez louise! my mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! now awesom-o, that is a bad robot! you can't do no chores for me unless i tell you to do them! you got it?!
now i'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', awesom-o, so that you'll learn better!  just know, awesom-o, that i did it because i love you. okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
look at that, awesom-o! i drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  ah i'll be right back. i'm gonna get some sunny delight. 
don't be silly, awesom-o. robots don't need to drink nothin'.  uh, heehee.  whoa. uh, go answer the door, awesom-o.
dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
why?
why?
who's at the door, awesom-o? 
hey he sure is! we do everything together. why last night we even had a slumber party. 
he can do anything i command him to. he's real smart. watch this: hey awesom-o, will you go get my friends some sunny delight?
oh wait. hey awesom-o,  i'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
oh, wonderful! the boys will be so excited.
oh boy! my robot gets to come with me to see aunt nellie?!
oh boy,  awesom-o! we're gonna have the best time ever! 
hello! it's nice to have you here.
oh oh, right through there, mr. robot.
awesom-o?
come on, awesom-o! we're gonna go a- sightseein'!
can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, awesom-o? aren't we havin' the best time?!
well, he can do anything. watch this: hey, awesom-o, who's gonna win the super bowl next year?
hey, mr. robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
watch this: awesom-o, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
come on, come on!
boy, los angeles is great, huh awesom-o? can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
hahaa, right! what are you gonna do with money, awesom-o? buy some robot pants? haha, no! we got each other and that's all we need, awesom-o. i'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
yoe, you okay awesom-o?
yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, aunt nellie. we're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
great, awesom-o, great. uh guys, take a break. i need a minute alone with awesom-o.  you are an incredible robot, awesom-o. i was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
well yeah, we're havin' a great time, aunt nellie. these movie studio guys are real nice.
yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. i can't believe it either. 
awesom-o? well, i gotta go, aunt nellie. ah, awesom-o is havin' some kind of malfunction.  awesom-o? hey, where'd ya go? 
good. i don't want that robot mobile until i know what it's capable of. all right, power it on. 
stand by. be ready to destroy it. 
are your systems stable? run a systems check on your cpu.
ah, i'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you.
what did you say?
your robot doesn't know it's a robot!
who made you, robot?
but, who would have programmed it to think it was human? the movie studio?
hey, wait a minute.  why, that's the van that-  oh my god!
hang on! i'm getting you out of here, robot!
fine. kill that son of a bitch!
awesom-o! 
hey, robots don't fart!
oh, and it, it smells, too!
hang on a second, here! 
wow, kid, you're a little faggot! 
yeah, i think they already moved in. i saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
yeah, i just moved here with my dad. are you gonna be my new friends?
it's my mask. my daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. my name's blanket.
wait! don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
whoa. dude, no way!
he's retired now.
come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. 
the jeffersons?
mr. jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
no way.
mememe! i'm first! i'm first!  oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
"let's ride the train! the train! 
would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?"
cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
let's ride and ride on the train together
on a journey through both of our minds.
choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
yeah. yeah, that counts.
you guys, i feel kinda bad for that kid.
mr. jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
nah, i'm not supposed to. dad says i have to keep my face hidden. 
no, my parents are.
what?
mr. jefferson, i have to go to school tomorrow!
he just showed up here.
"now let's all sleep and dream
heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
it's time for us all to say goodnight"
i think you're awesome too, cartman. 
yeah.
yeah.
you don't have to tell us twice, mom. that guy's a freak!
think i've got a little more work to do. 
jesus christ monkeyballs! it must be the same guy!
freeze, jefferson! the gig is up! you are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
it's ignorant. 
yes?
oh well, i certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. how about ten dollars?
how about fifteen dollars?
you've been on your fucking phone since we started!
a break from what?! you haven't done anything!
all you ever do is talk about your balls!
if you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
oh goodness, what happened?
oooh, no, come on inside.  wait right here, i'll be right back. 
ooo, oh dear, i'm sorry boys, but i've already hired someone else to do it.
a cheeg- fry?
"we've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
we can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me."
this is really gay.
it's mooey! mooey, wave to me! wave to me, mooey!
no, those are fine. peta doesn't care about people.
"wait. you guys, i have an awesome idea! we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""giant douche."""
(yeah, totally awesome!)
turd sandwich isn't better than giant douche.
"it was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""giant douche!"" it's way funnier!"
(giant douche.)
that's two against one, 'cause stan doesn't care. so it's giant douche.
you hate butters.
you misled him, fatass!
heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. now, what's the second?
and the second?
okay, i think, that's it. number 2?
gee, i don't know what to say, fellas. they're both instant classics. but i guess i'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
"all right, it's decided. let's all write in ""giant douche."""
and now your second nominee, turd sandwich. 
cartman? what the hell?!
you won't get more votes than us, asshole!
dude, i'm not going to lose to cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
...okay. i'll vote.
what do you guys want?
i haven't decided yet.
sure. 
a turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
whe-where as giant douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
i'm still not totally sure.
well, i just figured you'd vote for my guy! who's fuckin' friend are you?!  puffy!
jim, first of all i would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. and i would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.
it's pretty close, but it looks like giant douche is gonna win.
now your vote didn't matter.
...what?
that is fucking stupid, cartman!
it's like we're a real town now. 
my god. look at all these incredible bargains.
why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
you only need one copy, r-tard!
okay, fine, i will!  h-wait a minute! i don't even want one copy of time cop! 
thanks for coming to wall-mart.  all are welcome. all are welcome! 
cartman, stop it!
see?! that sucks, dude!
yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  and what about all the- 
yeah. that guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 
kumbaya, my lord, kumbaya. kumbaya, my lord...
it wasn't my idea to burn the wall-mart down.
dude, our town is going to be better without the-  what the?
looks like we're gonna have to go to arkansas. come on, guys. we're gonna put a stop to wall-mart once and for all!
three tickets to bentonville, arkansas, please.
no way! you wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the wall-mart.
"yeah, huh! you wanna go with us so that later you go, ""haha, i was working for wall-mart all along"" or something."
all right, fine. come on, fatass! 
i heard that!
you said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt wall-mart!
well hurry up if you're coming, cartman!
it would've been faster if cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
the heart of wall-mart?
every wall-mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
no, dude, don't! 
all right, this is it! if wall-mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! no matter what the wall-mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! let's do it.
i knew you were!
yes, i did! i said from the beginning that you would do this!
yes, i did!
yes, i did!
yes, i did!
yes. i did! 
-slashed the bus tires in arkansas! i said so! i told you the minute that i-  -and i told you that-
we don't have time for this! kenny, keep him away from us! 
oh, no! no!
trent boyett is being released from juvenile hall.
yeah.
is it true?! trent boyett is getting out?!
oh jesus, oh christ in heaven, i gotta hide!  uh, oh boy! 
totally, dude, let's play fireman.
shut up, fatass!
hey, kenny's right. we should put out a real fire. then we'll be heroes!
yeah, yeah. we play fireman all the time.
hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
my mom is gonna break my legs!
tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
dude, when he gets out of juvenile hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
now it's five years later. and trent boyett is being released.
are you having a nice day, ms. claridge? 
now, honey, we were trying to read. 
that's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out i've been lying for five years!
calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. we just need to go out and get some protection.
yeah? and what do we get for it? 
it'd have to be a good picture, too!  so long, fourthies!
you see, mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
but mom, my teacher will-
but mo-o-o-
what else has big round squishy globes? 
no, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
how do you know?!
oh all right, we'll let this trent boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!
(woohoo!)
man, i would have loved to seen to seen the look on trent boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
she won't talk to anybody, boys. some say... she's just given up hope. 
we're dead. trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
yes, but i'm gonna want something in return.
the thing is, ms. claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
i've been lookin' for you!  five years i've been waitin' for this day.
trent, look: we've realized our mistake! 
don't tell me that! i heard about the things you've done! but there were no magical christmas adventures or talking poo for me! i didn't get to fight a huge mechanic barbera stalker!! no accidental trips to afganastan for trent boyett!! 
what is that?
look, just take your punishment! you deserve it! let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
no! they did it! 
dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
yeah, woohoo!
hey, hold on a second!
i'm taking them to the bushes first!
welcome to s-super school news. i'm jimmy valmer.
the price of milk money will go up next monday to 49 cents. the school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in south park county.
eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. i've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. this is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. eric?
nu-noo, not yet. i've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and i haven't seen any celebrities. uh, about thirty minutes ago i thought i saw sigourney weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
jimmy and eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed south park's way. i asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on tuesday. guys?
another devastating loss for the cows last night, eric. they were ahead in the game until kelly anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in thailand. uh, kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the cows had to forfeit.
and we're... cut! &gt;&gt; /&gt;/&gt;
well, the students just aren't watching ya. your rating was only a four this whole week.
...craig's show??
kids don't care about the news, boys. it's boring. kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
i'm sorry, kids. y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. it's just that it's kind of gay. 
hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? 
if you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle.  come on!  there you go! 
oh hey guys. heard about your news show being cancelled.
(woohoo!)
(craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
how about we revamp the name? super school news sounds dry.
maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
hey, yeah. uh why i could say i saw celebrities even though i didn't, a-a-and then lie about what i saw them doing.
we have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?
sexy action school news team, ho! 
huh?
this is south park elementary school closed-circuit television. and now,  time with the sexy action school news! 
woowhoowoo!
the park county school board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, pete thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. we've also got confirmation that sally turner  stuffs her bra. and clyde donovan has only one testicle.
uh-oh, looks like it's panda bear madness minute! 
this isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
fellas! fellas, i got fant-tastic news! the vice-president, dick cheney, was in denver yesterday, and i got an interview with him for our news show. 
but this is real news!
how do you know?! you you haven't s-seen it yet!
well, in the interview, mr. cheney tells me all about how the-
we beat close-up animals!
i don't believe it.
what if we do a show where we-  uh, no.
thee... uhhh. what if the-?
crab people?
i know! we should read the funnies!  i always get good ideas from the funnies.
"yeah! i read 'em all the time! uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says ""well that's gonna add another hour to his time.""  yeah! you guys!  heh."
we're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
"how about this one? calminex?  ""warning: taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects."""
oh boy, i can't wait to be creative and smart.  hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
i think maybe he's f-feeling it.
whoa...  i'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
stan? stan, come on. we're gonna go find a frog. 
hey! let's run naked through the street! 
we took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. i didn't come up with anything.
this is closed-circuit television for south park elementary school. and now,  a sexy action news team special report: cough medicine abuse in school!  with the sexy action school news team!  it's the report you can't afford to miss!  and now here is rick cartman!
the cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! but one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  theradryl dm. for kids.  dexa cough, children's formula.
you need to know how important ratings are, craig, so, i'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically. 
nobody has any ideas?
dude, bail?
see you there, kev. 
aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. 
yeah? who invited you?
kelly who?
no! 
what? 
dude, i really don't think it's smart, cartman. 
it's not gonna work; just come down from there.
do it! do it!
don't listen to 'em, cartman! i'm sure it'll work. go for it. yaaay, cartman! fly, fly, fly!
awww, go on and do it already!
he's not gonna do it.
"seasons change, time passes by.
as the weeks become the months become the years."
oh my- doctor!  he's awake! 
you're at the hospital, eric. you've been in a coma for some time.
you're doing so much better, muffin.
we'd better get back to the station, sir.
all right, let's go, murphy. hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
i know it's ridiculous,  but i'm gonna explore every possibility i can!  hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?
young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
this is... where the body was found.  multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
stand back, give him room!  come on, kid, concentrate! what do you see in your mind?
we would give you a reward, but i guess that knowing the people of south park are safe again is reward enough.
all right, here's a hundred dollars.
oh, he will. my little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
cartman, what did you do?!
nice old mr. johansen runs a candy shop! he wasn't a killer and you know it!
because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
you don't have any powers!
he can't do crap!
there he is! hey, eric! eric!  we've got a little problem.
we'll pay you up front this time! we've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
whattaya got, wunderkind? are ya seeing anything?
yeah.
quiet! he's havin' a vision!
the copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. police used the help of eric cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. at the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of kentucky fried chicken. the young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
yeah!
you were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the psychic detective school. 
you must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
oh, goodness! what's going on?
enough!  we are ...obviously quite evenly matched. i guess this will have to be settled in court.
multiple arrests were made today for the murder of hillary neals. police raided the south park motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying.  the psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective eric cartman,  who is now the only psychic not behind bars. what an amazing coincidence.
you. you give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
oh yeah. awesome. hold on, just a second.  mom, there's some homeless guy here. make him go away. 
you are obviously a big fan of my work.
but i am the serial killer! the one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
and now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
before you die, let me show you the things that i've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  this... is me at the grand canyon.  do you see? this is me at mount rushmore  do you see?
do you see?!
here i am at the alamo in san antonio.  this was just outside of the gift shop. do you see?!
look! look at the things i've done! here i am at yellowstone national park!  do you see?! here are pictures of my trip to cheyenne for frontier days. do you see?!
well, mr. god, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. 
nope, this isn't our man.  we're sorry, mr. god. it appears we've wasted your time. 
that's it, no more pictures.  time to die.
your hand will be one with the others.
hold it right there, killer! 
well young man, i guess that just leaves one score to settle.
just stop it! that's enough! you aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
this whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being jewish at christmas again!
sorry, eric, but if kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else i'll get a call from his mother.
what happens to the lion cubs?
oh come on! it's obvious what happens! i get killed by santa claus so that christmas is saved!
all right, fine!
you're the best player at our school, dude. you'll make the team for sure.
dude, you were awesome, kyle.  look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? that's all you could do. 
i know. i deserve it.
hello, boys! it's me, your teacher! mrs. garrison! 
dude, is kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
you know what? i'm okay. even though i'm not truly a woman, i think i still like the new me. i'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag.  hey guys! this girl is staying a woman! who wants to pound my vadge! girl power!
hippies?
yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. ms. nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  hm, i don't like the sound of that. could i take a look in your attic?
oh my.
these are what we call the uh giggling stoners. pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. uh, whe-where's the backyard.
oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but i didn't think they were hurting anything.
oh, well, so, so what do i do?
whoa, how did i get here? man, i'm so high.
whoa, dude!
not cool!  what's up?! 
ooooo...what's that?
it is time to let us out! i'm sending your names! open this door right now!
let us out! 
what's wrong with you?!
this is a free country, man!
just go with it? we've been down here for days!
you can't go in there!
kid, we're have a city council meeting.
what are you talking about?
a what?
kid, what the hell are you talking about?
uh, eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.
johnson, get him out of here. 
well, so my idea was this: let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  whoa, what the hell?! 
cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
no!
what the hell are you doing?! 
there you are!
eric cartman, you are under arrest.
i was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
oh no, you're coming downtown! 
who was that?
you can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
i handled it, mayor. gee whiz.
i know. i signed the permit.
"i signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy."
they don't have to know. i can sign whatever permit i want!
all right, let's go.
uh huh hi eric, uh, how's it goin'?
eric, you were right. about the hippies. could you... get rid of them for us now?
we we need to take care of them, eric! they're out of control!
please. don't let them ruin our town.
we're just asking you to try. the whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
it's yours.
anything else?
well, we can promise not to buy one for kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  oh yes! fine! we'll force kyle to watch you.
you kids just haven't been to college yet. but just you wait, this thing is about to get huge.
my god...
nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. that hippie crowd is massive! how the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? it's a suicide mission!
i have to do it, steven.
you got a better ides, steven?! dammit, my son is in there!
now, now, don't cry, ladies. everything's gonna be fine.
godspeed! 
check.
online
hey, you can't go up there. hoohoo, woo! 
he's right. it's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. 
somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
...i didn't volunteer!
we made it, we made it!
which cord is it?
nyugh!
i'm alive! 
whoa, cartman. we aren't gonna be hippies anymore. y-you don't have to kill us.
kill you? oh no. i have much bigger plans for you now.
token sings?
how come we never get opportunities like that?
we're not talented?
yeah. we're too smart to be talented.
probably.
hey yeah! we deserve that money just as much as he does.
he's looking at the sign.
all right.
why?
it's genius.
nothin'
yeah.
i'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
this will only take a second.
ohhhh token. right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
...yeah?
can i talk to you?! 
what the hell are you doing?!
abraham lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
yes he does!
token actually pays attention in school! unlike you, fatass!
you guys, we're gonna lose our client. 
well, i guess that makes sense. all right. 
(hey, terrific!)
oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
we knew you could do it!
(all right!)
uh excuse me, token already has representation.
oh my god! okay!
oh, come on, guys. you have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?  do you like steak, token? i know a great place for you locally. 
all that time and effort we spent helping token and this is the thanks we get?!
aww, that's too bad. she just got accepted to be on american idol in ros angeres, but i can't take her 'cause i have to mind the restaurant. 
rearry?
jesus, we made it just in time! 
oh crap!
ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. if your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
aw, just forget it! 
we can't wait in line! we have to be in school on monday!
really?
and fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, wing!
oh my god, dude!
awww! 
anyone? help four boys and a chinese woman get back to colorado?
mr. stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  he really likes her voice.  you know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.
he'll pay her four thousand dollars.
get out!
yeah!
who? who? who who?
who? who? who who?
what do you mean? we thought she was with you.
...oh jesus christ. if that big caa talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
wing?
they did it to us again! that dirty talent agency stole our client again!
damn, caa is pretty impressive.
"""it's just four little boys"" "
hello? we want to talk to somebody right now!
no! screw that, dude! if we keep letting caa take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
cartman! 
enough!  i have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. but you come any closer and i'll blow her brains out.
me too.
oh... hey guys.  what, what are you doin' here?
yeah. well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  i'm trying to work my way back home.
sing, sing a song.
oh, poopie-kins, it's very early.
sweetie, can't we go after school?
everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! we're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! let's go!
i can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when i show up to school with a psp! i wonder if kyle will cry? oh please let kyle cry!  what the hell?!
(friday)
hey dickhole! what do you think you're doing?
there's no saving place, fourthie! get to the back or we'll beat your face in!
"it's a game called ""heaven versus hell."" kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of satan.  dude, you see what kenny got?"
wuh what'd i do?
that's... really touching.
"to eric cartman: ""eric, i never really liked you. but then, nobody does. you have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. it is only because i feel so sorry for you that i leave you my sony psp."""
i don't know. i lost the last page.
it's right here, along with kenny's other belongings. they're all yours.
he can't respond to you, boys. being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain.
he's alive. he-ee smiles when i talk to him. i think...
yeah, the lawyer lost that page.
he did? when?
he did not say that! you just want him dead so you can have his stupid psp!
he did not!
did not!
kenny remains our only hope! here is what we must do.  gabriel and uriel, you go down to earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. in the meantime  we will put all our troops at heaven's gate. we will try to keep hell's army from breaking through as long as possible.  hopefully, it will be long enough to get our keanu reeves back.
well i'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. i don't believe you have any legal authority here.
best friends forever?
what?
we all have bffs, and we believe that a bff is the highest legal authority.
we want all the country to see that kenny is alive, and in pain!
you say tomato, but i say kenny!
uuhh, excuse me. i uh, just found the last page of kenny's will. 
that's it. south park wins the game 4 to 0.
we can start having fun again! 
congratulations, boys! you're goin' on to the post-season. woohoo!
i can't believe it. i can't believe we have to keep on playing.
guess that's my guy. i can take him, no problem. 
damnit!
ball!
aw, jesus! 
no!
ball four!
walk to first! woo!
strike three!
we're so proud of you kids!
dude, what are we gonna do? we can't win this game.
like that motorcycle kid in bad news bears.
yeah! we're about to get our asses kicked!
wow, he is great at sucking.
god, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
she's here!
i want some!
i want a breast!
it won't take a minute.
oh boy!  cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
the skin's the best part...
that sounds great!
i think i have extra.
thanks. 
ohoho, nhn.
aww, that's tragic.
i never realized ignoring him was an option.
lu lu lu, i've got some apples. lu lu lu, you've got some too-
hey eric! 
"huh i just said, ""hey eric!"""
well, sure i can see you.
well, jeez eric, why wouldn't i be able to hear you?
because, butters, i'm... dead. 
you died?? how??
but if you're d-dead, how come i can see you?
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
nuh-nothing to be scared of. jus, just some lightning and thunder.  gah! wasn't nothin' neither. j-just a mouse. 
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 
go away! you aren't real!
y yes, yes sir. 
ah- 
but i don't want to see you!
well... how do you know you're supposed to go to heaven?
well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... heck.
oh.
i can't. ahah i have school tomorrow.
oh, what is it?
oh, that's so nice.
he wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
kyle, eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking jew.  he's asking for your forgiveness. and and he wants you to just remember the good times.
there were no good times! and if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
he can't! don't you understand?!
god forgave the jews, you should be able to forgive him!
yeah, we know better than to think that.
aww, that's okay, eric.
so i won't see you again?
wow.
yeh you're still here.
well, i guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
did you ever do anything really bad?
not really...
broke fence...
boy oh boy, eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
really. i mean, honestly, i don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
"i'm gonna make, make it right.
i'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
make, make it right.
i'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
it feels so good to be making up
for all the things i've done wrong.
i know now what the good lord in heaven
wanted from me all along.
all along, i'm gonna make, make it right.
'cause jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
not faking it, i'm making it right.
i'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
make, make it right!
make, make it right!
gonna make it right, girl, i've got to have your lovin' tonight!"
does this mean... you have to go now?
oh jeez. i i guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
ahhh. 
aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
please leave me alone, eric. my bottom is really sore.
eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
hey, i think she could see you too. you really are a ghost.
tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the red cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. the violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash.
you get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!
go in there? uh, but they'll see me.
eric.  well, be careful, ghost pal.
i have no idea.
tom, an incredible story of courage. two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the red cross. nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.
boy, we sure did.
yeah. uh i feel that way too.
i'll miss you too, ghost pal.
yeah. s-see ya, eric. 
huh?
huh but i thought you were one!
he's what... oh, you do? r-right now, right now it is? m'kay, m'kay. don't worry, jimmy.  n'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. um, eric, why don't you come up here?
it's occupied. 
hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! how about a courtesy flush?!
jerk! 
i'm trying to get laid. what's it look like?
wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, eric. have you gotten laid before?
well, wha-what do i do?
eric, i can't tell you why, but it's very important that i score to-night! can you come on the date and help me? you're like a white... hitch.
hi jimmy.
you know that girl sally rauman at our school? i can't stand her.
"really? well, kelligan bought the same purse and i was like, ""no way do i want it now!"" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? and so-"
"it's like i told debbie: ""if you're gonna go out with my friends-"""
oh, i'm so glad you think so, shawna, because i really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.
creep! 
and now we have eric cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, scarface. 
dude, you are right, cartman. your uncle roy has a sweet boat.
man, i wish i could really drive this thing.
sure i do!
dude, i don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
okay, turn on the ignition,
okay... 
we're not moving.
boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! they only have the... oh wait wait. neutral button! 
jesus christ!!!
oh dude! oh jesus!
you said you'd take responsibility to your uncle roy!
what?
oh god, i hope i didn't hurt any beavers.
dude! dude, did you see the news last night?
you saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
pretty funny?! dude, we did that!! that was our fault!
but they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
maybe they couldn't get out!
dude, ah i just...  ah i don't know what to do here.
nothing
hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in beaverton! 
dude, you have to tell everyone. right now.
stan, people in beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
how?
we can't get out! the flames are too big!
oh my god. quick! radio the helicopters!
it's- it's helicopters! they finally came to help everyone! 
what are you doing?
what gold??
no, cartman, i have no idea what you're talking about!
jews do not carry gold in a little bag around their necks.cartman! stop playing around!
dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! we're gonna die!
goddamnit, you know i don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, cartman! whattaya want from me?!
...okay, fine! here!  now let's go!
do you think i'm stupid?! i know that all jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! hand over the real jew gold, kyle!!  no! noooooo! 
stop it! stop it!! first it was terrorists, then george bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! it's my fault. i broke the dam. 
i broke the dam.
yeah, us too.
what?
you, sir, mocked cartman before, yet you two sit here demanding answers!  now damn you, let him speak!
okay. i'm not lookin'. 
i... don't believe it.
believe it. the girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. freeze image!  gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
it's all set. once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
the outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
let's go take it!
so what do you suggest?
yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
you mean like that movie, juwanna mann?
but if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
oh uh, hi mom.
n'aw geez! now i'm gonna get grounded, too.
no, wait. what... what's he doing? 
nooooo!! nooooo!! my son is dead!! noooo!!
oh... thank you. 
that girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
oh. uhm, you know. girl places.
you're gonna be fine.
good luck, man. 
jesus, what are they doing in there?
he's just dancing around.
my mom?  hello?
well, i'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
well, i'm workin' on it.
now look! i'm getting pretty sick of this! well i put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! uh... mom.
he got it! he got the device! 
what the hell?
it isn't right! make it go away!
ho-hold on on guys. we're not sure what this device is capable of. maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
how come you get to use it first?
i wanna use it.
nah dude, then it won't be fun tow watch.
you mean destroy it?
we got it away from the girls. that's what matters. but now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
it's too much power. for anybody. stan's right. it has to be destroyed.
nobody will. that's the way it's suppose to be. hit it, kenny. 
damnit, damnit! stan and kyle's egg is still doin' fine! those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan!  yes, what?!  what the hell is this?!
you broke your egg?? uh but you're partnered with a girl.
did you tell anyone else about this?
did you tell your egg partner, heidi?
i can't do that, eric!
you have to get an a, eric. here: i'll sign this new egg for you. we'll pretend this never happened, all right?  just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... there we go, good as new.  go enjoy the rest of your recess.
...okay, well, you're welcome, eric. now, just run along. 
because i'm a nice teacher, all right?
nothing! it's all okay! just take your damn egg!
eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! you're taking that egg! and if you break it again, i'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! do you hear me?!
okay, very nice, token. thank you. 'k kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah eric.
what?!
that's not true, fatass! i have red hair, and i don't have to avoid the sun!
this is all a bunch of crap!
fine, i will! 
thanks butters
eric honey, time to get up for school. 
poopsiekins!  sweetie, what is the-  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
oh my god! eric!
yes, i'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.
well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. it must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.
oh... 
all right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. it's very important that you keep eric out of the sun. the sun... is his worst enemy.
wow, cartman. you look... different.
you mean,you're a ginger?
is that an umbrella you're using?
...wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
well, i mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
hm. i don't really see the irony in that, kyle. 
maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
what are you doing?
you're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
you know the rule. no ginger kids in the cafeteria.
dude, check it out. 
we did it guys. we finally taught cartman a lesson. i'll bet that now, cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
yeah!
my dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
ron howard?
ron howard? 
yeah!
red power!
red power!
red power!
red power!
yeah!
red power!
i don't believe it.
nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
red power!
better red than dead!
"tom, i'm standing outside the denver center for the performing arts, where the new production of ""annie"" has just premiered to cries of outrage.  a rapidly-growing organization called the ginger separatist movement is furious that the lead role of annie  is being played by a girl  who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, eric cartman."
what harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
yeah! that's right! 
okay, welcome, everyone. it's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first all-ginger pride conference!  now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, eric cartman!
red power!
yeah!!
hello there! gary nelson with hilton guest relations. just making sure you guys have everything you need. 
need any buffet items restocked? everyone okay on coffee?
great. oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the airport hilton for your conference.
ex-terminate?
i think we're at the sunset room at the airport hilton.
oh jesus, i should have known!
you guys got everything you need in here? need more coffee, buffet items?
how about lava? you got enough lava?
okay. hey, thanks for choosin' the airport hilton, guys.
cartman! i need to tell you something!
aah i think you'd rather hear this in private!
yeah!
huh? what?
but... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
but you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
what did that kid in the green hat tell you?
that kid right there. what did he just tell you?
you wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. what did he tell you?
ginger or not, it's all the same.
"black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. 
hand in hand, we can live together."
we shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
you are such a manipulative asshole, cartman.
oh dude, check it out. i got a jake plummer.
i can't spend any money. i'm saving up for that bike i want.
so what should we do now? it's saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
no, i don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  let's just do something fun that's free.
well i can't spend any money.
neither did i! but now, if you guys can't accept this great thing i belong to, then i suppose we're no longer friends! 
and now, jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! 
now get ready for jambu's next trick. 
how about that, folks! a full body flip! and now, kelly's gonna show us how she makes jambu do his tricks.  when kelly slaps her hand three times, jambu comes to her. jambu will stay and wait until kelly gives him a command.  oh, what trick are we gonna see? get those cameras ready!  that's kelly riding on jambu's nose!  i wish kelly would ride on my nose. 
okay, where to next?
let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
dude, everyone's leaving! we can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
i'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. i-i wanna hang out here some more.
and for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. we invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by.
jambu! jambu, i'm back!  how are you feeling?  huhm. jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  ja- jambu? are you still feelin' lonely here?
goddammit, say something!
the... that's where all orca whales are from. if i don't get back to the moon, i'm going to die.
they want twenty million dollars.
whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.
damnit!  tell me what to do, willzy-x! how do we get you home??
which highway did they take??
hang on, willzy-x. hang on, buddy.

hang on.  hold on a second.  i gues... i... guess... this is... goodbye, willzy-x.  i'm gonna miss you.  hey, don't forget me, okay? i won't forget you. 
all right. thanks for your help, dudes.  well, we did it, guys. it wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.

this is sooo embarrassing.
you know, i didn't even get home until 2:30.
